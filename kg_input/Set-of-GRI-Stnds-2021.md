# Introduction  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 introduces the purpose and system of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) and explains key concepts for sustainability reporting. It also specifies the requirements and reporting principles that organizations must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. GRI 1 is the first Standard that organizations should consult to understand how to report using the GRI Standards.  

GRI 1 is structured as follows:  

Section 1 introduces the purpose and the system of the GRI Standards.   
Section 2 explains the key concepts that are used throughout the GRI Standards.   
Section 3 specifies the requirements for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards.   
Section 4 specifies the reporting principles, which are fundamental to ensuring the quality of the reported information.   
Section 5 presents recommendations for the organization to align its sustainability reporting with other types of reporting and to enhance the credibility of its sustainability reporting.   
The Appendixes provide guidance on how to prepare a GRI content index.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

# 1. Purpose and system of GRI Standards  

# 1.1 Purpose of the GRI Standards  

Through their activities and business relationships, organizations can have an effect on the economy, environment, and people, and in turn make negative or positive contributions to sustainable development. Sustainable development refers to ‘development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ [8]. The objective of sustainability reporting using the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) is to provide transparency on how an organization contributes or aims to contribute to sustainable development.  

The GRI Standards enable an organization to publicly disclose its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights and how the organization manages these impacts. This enhances transparency on the organization’s impacts and increases organizational accountability.  

The Standards contain disclosures that allow an organization to report information about its impacts consistently and credibly. This enhances the global comparability and quality of reported information on these impacts, which supports information users in making informed assessments and decisions about the organization’s impacts and contribution to sustainable development.  

The GRI Standards are based on expectations for responsible business conduct set out in authoritative intergovernmental instruments, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [3] and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [5] (see the Bibliographies of the GRI Standards for a list of authoritative instruments used in developing the GRI Standards). Information reported using the GRI Standards can help users assess whether an organization meets the expectations set out in these instruments. It is important to note that the GRI Standards do not set allocations, thresholds, goals, targets, or any other benchmarks for good or bad performance.  

# 1.2 Users  

Any organization can use the GRI Standards – regardless of size, type, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights.  

The reported information can be used by the organization in its decision-making, for example, when setting goals and targets, or when assessing and implementing its policies and practices.  

Stakeholders and other information users can use the GRI Standards to understand what organizations are expected to report about. Stakeholders can also use an organization’s reported information to assess how they are affected or how they could be affected by the organization’s activities.  

Investors, in particular, can use the reported information to assess an organization’s impacts and how it integrates sustainable development in its business strategy and model. They can also use this information to identify financial risks and opportunities related to the organization’s impacts and to assess its long-term success. Users other than the organization’s stakeholders, such as academics and analysts, can also use the reported information for purposes such as research or benchmarking.  

The term ‘information users’ in the GRI Standards refers to all these diverse users of the organization’s reported information.  

# 1.3 System of GRI Standards  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard). The Universal Standards are used by all organizations when reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. Organizations use the Sector Standards according to the sectors in which they operate, and the Topic Standards according to their list of material topics.  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

An organization begins by consulting GRI 1: Foundation 2021. GRI 1 introduces the purpose and system of GRI Standards and explains key concepts for sustainability reporting. It also specifies the requirements and reporting principles that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies. This information gives insight into the profile and scale of the organization and provides a context for understanding the organization’s impacts.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides step-by-step guidance on how to determine material topics. GRI 3 also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics, and when determining what information to report for the material topics.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures for the organization to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The Topic Standards cover a wide range of topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# 1.4 Using the GRI Standards  

All disclosures in the GRI Standards contain requirements. The requirements list information that an organization must report or provide instructions that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), then the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but it is required to report that the item does not exist.  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout the GRI Standards:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# Reporting format  

In the GRI Standards, the term ‘sustainability reporting’ refers to the process of reporting, which starts with an organization determining its material topics based on its most significant impacts and results in the organization publicly reporting information about these impacts.  

The organization can publish or make information accessible in a range of formats (e.g., electronic, paper-based) across one or more locations (e.g., a standalone sustainability report, web pages, an annual report). The terms ‘report’ and ‘reported information’ in the GRI Standards both refer to information reported across all locations.  

The GRI content index provides an overview of the organization’s reported information and shows the location where information users can find it. The content index also shows which GRI Standards and disclosures the organization has used.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Effective date  

All GRI Standards have an effective date. This is the date from when the information published by an organization must make use of a particular GRI Standard. All information published after the effective date of a Standard must make use of that Standard.  

For example, GRI 1: Foundation 2021 has an effective date of 1 January 2023. This means that the organization must make use of GRI 1 for the information it publishes on or after 1 January 2023.  

Effective dates are set keeping in mind that organizations may need time to adopt a new or revised Standard. Adoption of a Standard before its effective date is encouraged, as this allows the organization to report according to best practice.  

# 2. Key concepts  

This section explains the concepts that lay the foundation for sustainability reporting. Understanding how these concepts are applied in the GRI Standards is essential for those who collect and prepare information for reporting and those who interpret information that is reported using the Standards.  

The key concepts covered in this section are: impact, material topics, due diligence, and stakeholder. The purpose of the Standards is to enable organizations to report information about their most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights – in the GRI Standards these are referred to as material topics. Due diligence and stakeholder engagement help organizations identify their most significant impacts.  

# 2.1 Impact  

In the GRI Standards, impact refers to the effect an organization has or could have on the economy, environment, and people, including effects on their human rights, as a result of the organization’s activities or business relationships. The impacts can be actual or potential, negative or positive, short-term or long-term, intended or unintended, and reversible or irreversible. These impacts indicate the organization’s contribution, negative or positive, to sustainable development.  

The organization’s impacts on the economy refer to the impacts on economic systems at local, national, and global levels. An organization can have an impact on the economy through, for example, its competition practices, its procurement practices, and its taxes and payments to governments.  

The organization’s impacts on the environment refer to the impacts on living organisms and non-living elements, including air, land, water, and ecosystems. An organization can have an impact on the environment through, fo example, its use of energy, land, water, and other natural resources.  

The organization’s impacts on people refer to the impacts on individuals and groups, such as communities, vulnerable groups, or society. This includes the impacts the organization has on people’s human rights. An organization can have an impact on people through, for example, its employment practices (e.g., the wages it pays to employees), its supply chain (e.g., the working conditions of workers of suppliers), and its products and services (e.g., their safety or accessibility). Individuals or groups that have interests that are affected or could be affected by the organization’s activities are referred to as stakeholders (see section 2.4 in this Standard for more information).  

The impacts on the economy, environment, and people are interrelated. For example, an organization’s impacts on the economy and environment can result in impacts on people and their human rights. Similarly, an organization’s positive impacts can result in negative impacts and vice versa. For example, an organization's positive impacts on the environment can lead to negative impacts on people and their human rights.  

# 2.2 Material topics  

An organization may identify many impacts on which to report. When using the GRI Standards, the organization prioritizes reporting on those topics that represent its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. In the GRI Standards, these are the organization’s material topics.  

Examples of material topics are anti-corruption, occupational health and safety, or water and effluents. A topic need not be limited to impacts on the economy, the environment, or people; it can cover impacts across all three dimensions. For example, an organization might determine that ‘water and effluents’ is a material topic based on the impacts its water use has on ecosystems and local communities’ access to water. The GRI Standards group impacts into topics, like ‘water and effluents’, to help organizations report cohesively about multiple impacts that relate to the same topic.  

The process of determining material topics is informed by the organization’s ongoing identification and assessment of impacts. The ongoing identification and assessment of impacts involves engaging with relevant stakeholders and experts and it is conducted independently of the sustainability reporting process. See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information on determining material topics.  

# Box 1. Sustainability reporting and financial and value creation reporting  

The GRI Standards enable organizations to report information about the most significant impacts of their activities and business relationships on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. Such impacts are of primary importance to sustainable development and to organizations’ stakeholders, and they are the focus of sustainability reporting.  

The impacts of an organization’s activities and business relationships on the economy, environment, and people can have negative and positive consequences for the organization itself. These consequences can be operational or reputational, and therefore in many cases financial. For example, an organization’s high use of non-renewable energy contributes to climate change and could, at the same time, result in increased operating costs for the organization due to legislation that seeks to shift energy use toward renewable sources.  

Even if not financially material at the time of reporting, most, if not all, of the impacts of an organization’s activities and business relationships on the economy, environment, and people will eventually become financially material issues. Therefore, the impacts are also important for those interested in the organization's financial performance and long-term success. Understanding these impacts is a necessary first step in determining related financially material issues for the organization.  

Sustainability reporting is therefore crucial for financial and value creation reporting. Information made available through sustainability reporting provides input for identifying financial risks and opportunities related to the organization’s impacts and for financial valuation. This, in turn, helps to make financial materiality judgments about what to recognize in financial statements.  

While the impacts of the organization’s activities and business relationships on the economy, environment, and people may become financially material, sustainability reporting is also highly relevant in its own right as a public interest activity. Sustainability reporting is independent of the consideration of financial implications. It is therefore important for the organization to report on all the material topics that it has determined using the GRI Standards. These material topics cannot be deprioritized on the basis of not being considered financially material by the organization.  

# 2.3 Due diligence  

In the GRI Standards, due diligence refers to the process through which an organization identifies, prevents, mitigates, and accounts for how it addresses its actual and potential negative impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. The organization should address potential negative impacts through prevention or mitigation. It should address actual negative impacts through remediation in cases where the organization identifies it has caused or contributed to those impacts.  

The way the organization is involved with negative impacts (i.e., whether it causes or contributes to the impacts, or whether the impacts are directly linked by its business relationships) determines how the organization should address the impacts. It also determines whether the organization has a responsibility to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of the impacts. The organization should:  

avoid causing or contributing to negative impacts through its own activities, and address such impacts when they occur by providing for or cooperating in their remediation through legitimate processes; in the case of negative impacts that are directly linked to the organization’s operations, products, or services by its business relationships, seek to prevent or mitigate these impacts even if it has not contributed to them. The organization is not responsible for providing for or cooperating in the remediation of these impacts, but it can play a role in doing so.  

If it is not feasible to address all identified impacts on the economy, environment, and people at once, the organization should prioritize the order in which to address potential negative impacts based on their severity and likelihood. In the case of potential negative human rights impacts, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood. See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information.  

Due diligence is elaborated by the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [5], the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [3], and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [2].  

# 2.4 Stakeholder  

Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have interests that are affected or could be affected by an organization’s activities. Common categories of stakeholders for organizations are business partners, civil society organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other workers, governments, local communities, non-governmental organizations, shareholders and other investors, suppliers, trade unions, and vulnerable groups.  

In the GRI Standards, an interest (or ‘stake’) is something of value to an individual or group, which can be affected by the activities of an organization. Stakeholders can have more than one interest. Not all interests are of equal importance and they do not all need to be treated equally. Human rights have a particular status as an entitlement of all people under international law. The most acute impacts the organization can have on people are those that negatively affect their human rights. The term ‘rightsholders’ refers to stakeholders whose individual human rights or collective rights (held by groups such as indigenous peoples) are or could be affected.  

Stakeholder interests can be negatively or positively affected by the organization’s activities. Due diligence focuses on identifying stakeholder interests that are or could be negatively affected by the organization’s activities.  

Stakeholders may not always have a direct relationship with the organization. For example, the workers in the organization’s supply chain can also be its stakeholders, or there can be individuals or groups living at a distance from the organization’s operations who can be affected or potentially affected by these operations. They may not be aware that they are stakeholders of that particular organization, especially if they have not yet been affected by its activities. The organization should identify the interests of these and other stakeholders who are unable to articulate their views (e.g., future generations).  

Engaging with stakeholders helps the organization identify and manage its negative and positive impacts. Not all stakeholders will be affected by all activities of the organization. The organization should identify the stakeholders whose interests have to be taken into account in connection with a specific activity (i.e., ‘relevant stakeholders’).  

Where it is impossible to engage with all relevant stakeholders directly, the organization can engage with credible stakeholder representatives or proxy organizations (e.g., non-governmental organizations, trade unions).  

In addition to engaging with stakeholders, the organization can consult with experts in specific issues or contexts (e.g., academics, non-governmental organizations) for advice on identifying and managing its impacts.  

Sometimes it is necessary to distinguish between stakeholders whose interests have been affected (i.e., ‘affected stakeholders’), and those whose interests have not yet been affected but could potentially be affected (i.e., ‘potentially affected stakeholders’). This distinction is important in due diligence. For example, if an organization’s activity leads to a safety hazard, workers who are injured because of the hazard are affected stakeholders, and workers who have not yet been injured but who are exposed to the hazard and could be injured are potentially affected stakeholders. The distinction between affected and potentially affected stakeholders helps identify which workers should receive remedy.  

See reference [2] in the Bibliography.  

# 3. Reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards  

Reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards enables an organization to provide a comprehensive picture of its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts. This allows information users to make informed assessments and decisions about the organization’s impacts and its contribution to sustainable development.  

The organization must comply with all nine requirements in this section to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

# Overview of in accordance requirements  

Requirement 1: Apply the reporting principles   
Requirement 2: Report the disclosures in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021   
Requirement 3: Determine material topics   
Requirement 4: Report the disclosures in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021   
Requirement 5: Report disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards for each material topic   
Requirement 6: Provide reasons for omission for disclosures and requirements that the organization cannot comply with   
Requirement 7: Publish a GRI content index   
Requirement 8: Provide a statement of use   
Requirement 9: Notify GRI  

If the organization does not comply with all nine requirements, it cannot claim that it has prepared the reported information in accordance with the GRI Standards. In such a case, the organization may be able to claim that it has prepared the reported information with reference to the GRI Standards, provided it complies with the requirements specified in ‘Reporting with reference to the GRI Standards’ at the end of this section.  

# Requirement 1: Apply the reporting principles  

a. The organization shall apply all the reporting principles specified in section 4 of GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

# Requirement 2: Report the disclosures in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021  

a. The organization shall report all disclosures in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021.  

# Guidance  

Reasons for omission are permitted for all disclosures in GRI 2 except for:  

Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details   
Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability reporting   
Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point   
Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information   
Disclosure 2-5 External assurance  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted, then the organization is required to specify in the GRI content index the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission with an explanation. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.  

# Requirement 3: Determine material topics  

The organization shall:  

a. determine its material topics;  

b. review the GRI Sector Standard(s) that apply to its sector(s) and: i. determine whether each topic in the applicable Sector Standard(s) is a material topic for the organization; ii. list in the GRI content index any topics from the applicable Sector Standard(s) that the organization has determined as not material and explain why they are not material.  

# Guidance  

See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for guidance on how to determine material topics.  

The organization is required to determine its material topics based on its specific circumstances.  

Using the GRI Sector Standards supports the organization in this process. The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics.  

The organization is required to use the applicable Sector Standards when determining its material topics.  

# Guidance to 3-b  

The organization is required to comply with Requirement 3-b only if GRI Sector Standards that apply to its sectors are available.  

The organization is required to review each topic described in the applicable Sector Standards and determine whether it is a material topic for the organization. If the organization has determined any of the topics included in the applicable Sector Standards as not material, then the organization is required to list them in the GRI content index and explain why they are not material. See Requirement 7 in this Standard for more information on the content index.  

See section 1 in GRI 3 and the GRI Sector Standards for guidance on how to use the Sector Standards to determine material topics.  

# Requirement 4: Report the disclosures in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021  

The organization shall:  

a. report its process of determining material topics using Disclosure 3-1;   
b. report a list of its material topics using Disclosure 3-2;   
c. report how it manages each material topic using Disclosure 3-3.  

# Guidance  

Reasons for omission are only permitted for Disclosure 3-3 Management of material topics in GRI 3.  

If the organization cannot comply with Disclosure 3-3 or with a requirement in Disclosure 3-3, then the organization is required to specify this in the GRI content index, and to provide a reason for omission with an explanation. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.  

# Requirement 5: Report disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards for each material topic  

The organization shall:  

a. report disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards for each material topic;   
b. for each material topic covered in the applicable GRI Sector Standard(s), either: i. report the disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards listed for that topic in the Sector Standard(s), or; ii. provide the ‘not applicable’ reason for omission and the required explanation in the GRI content index.  

# Guidance to 5-a  

For each material topic, the organization needs to identify disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards to report. The organization is required to report only those disclosures relevant to its impacts in relation to a material topic. The organization is not required to report disclosures that are not relevant.  

There is no requirement for a minimum number of disclosures to report from the Topic Standards. The number of disclosures that the organization reports is based on its assessment of which disclosures are relevant to its impacts in relation to a material topic.  

The organization may need to use more than one Topic Standard to report on a material topic. In addition, not all disclosures in a Topic Standard may be relevant for the organization to report. For example, an organization identifies pay equality as a material topic. The organization determines that the following disclosures are relevant to report on the topic: Disclosure 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage in GRI 202: Market Presence 2016, and Disclosure 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men in GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016. The organization is not required to report other disclosures from these Standards (e.g., Disclosure 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community in GRI 202), as these disclosures do not address the topic of pay equality.  

When a material topic is covered in the applicable GRI Sector Standards, the organization uses the Sector Standards to identify disclosures to report. See Requirement 5-b in this Standard for more information.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for all disclosures from the Topic Standards. If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure, then the organization is required to specify in the GRI content index the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission with an explanation. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.  

The organization should provide sufficient information about its impacts in relation to each material topic so that information users can make informed assessments and decisions about the organization. If the disclosures from the Topic Standards do not provide sufficient information about the organization’s impacts, then the organization should report additional disclosures. These can include the additional sector disclosures recommended in the GRI Sector Standards, disclosures from other sources, or disclosures developed by the organization itself.  

Disclosures that the organization reports from other sources or that are developed by the organization itself, should have the same rigor as disclosures from the GRI Standards, and they should align with expectations set out in authoritative intergovernmental instruments.  

# Reporting on material topics not covered in the GRI Topic Standards  

When the organization's material topic is not covered by the disclosures in the GRI Topic Standards, the organization is required to report how it manages the material topic, using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021. See Requirement 4-c in this Standard for more information.  

In addition to reporting Disclosure 3-3, the organization should report other disclosures for that topic. These can include the additional sector disclosures recommended in the GRI Sector Standards, disclosures from other sources, or disclosures developed by the organization itself.  

For example, an organization determines freedom of speech to be a material topic. As there is no Topic Standard that covers this topic, the organization should report disclosures from other sources or develop its own disclosures to report on the topic. The organization is still required to report how it manages the topic of freedom of speech, using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# Guidance to 5-b  

The organization is required to comply with Requirement 5-b only if GRI Sector Standards that apply to its sectors are available. The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics.  

The organization is required to review each topic described in the applicable Sector Standards and determine whether it is a material topic for the organization.  

If the organization determines a topic in an applicable Sector Standard to be material, the Sector Standard helps the organization identify disclosures to report information about its impacts in relation to that topic. For each likely material topic, the Sector Standards list disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards for organizations to report. If any of the Topic Standards disclosures listed in the Sector Standards are not relevant to the organization’s impacts, the organization is not required to report these. However, the organization is required to list these disclosures in the GRI content index and provide ‘not applicable’ as the reason for omission for not reporting the disclosures. The organization is also required to explain in brief why the disclosures are not relevant to its impacts in relation to the material topic. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.  

Note that when reporting the Topic Standards disclosures listed in the Sector Standards, the organization can still use any of the four reasons for omission included in Table 1 of this Standard if it cannot comply with the disclosure or with a requirement in the disclosure.  

Besides the disclosures from the Topic Standards, the Sector Standards may list additional sector disclosures for organizations to report. Reporting these additional sector disclosures is a recommendation. The organization is not required to provide a reason for omission for the additional sector disclosures it does not report.  

# Requirement 6: Provide reasons for omission for disclosures and requirements that the organization cannot comply with  

a. If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted, the organization shall in the GRI content index: i. specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with; ii. provide one of the four reasons for omission included in Table 1 and the required explanation for that reason.

# Guidance  

Reasons for omission are permitted for all disclosures from the GRI Standards except for:  

Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details   
Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability reporting   
Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point   
Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information   
Disclosure 2-5 External assurance   
Disclosure 3-1 Process to determine material topics   
Disclosure 3-2 List of material topics  

The organization is only permitted to provide one of the four reasons for omission included in Table 1 of this Standard:  

# Not applicable  

The organization provides ‘not applicable’ as the reason for omission in the following situations:  

When a disclosure or a requirement in a disclosure does not apply to the organization based on its characteristics (e.g., size, type). For example, 2-15-b-iii in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires the organization to report whether conflicts of interest relating to the existence of controlling shareholders are disclosed to stakeholders. This requirement does not apply to organizations that do not have shareholders (e.g., foundations).  

In such cases, the organization is required to explain why the disclosure or the requirement does not apply to the organization.  

However, there may be cases where a disclosure or a requirement in a disclosure applies to the organization, but the organization does not have in place the item specified in the disclosure or in the requirement (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process). For example, 2-23-b in GRI 2 requires the organization to describe its policy commitment to respect human rights. This expectation applies to every organization. All organizations are expected to have a policy commitment to respect human rights, but not every organization may have developed such a policy commitment yet.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. It does not need to provide the ‘not applicable’ reason for omission.  

In such cases, the organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

When a disclosure from the GRI Topic Standards that is listed in the applicable GRI Sector Standards is not relevant to the organization’s impacts in relation to a material topic. In such cases, the organization is required to explain why the disclosure is not relevant to its impacts in relation to the material topic.  

# Legal prohibitions  

The organization provides ‘legal prohibitions’ as the reason for omission when the law forbids collecting the required information or reporting it publicly.  

# Confidentiality constraints  

There may be cases where the law does not forbid collecting or reporting the required information, but the organization considers the information confidential and cannot report it publicly. In such cases, the organization provides ‘confidentiality constraints’ as the reason for omission.  

# Information unavailable/incomplete  

There may be cases where the organization has the item specified in a disclosure or in a requirement in a disclosure, but the information about the item is unavailable or incomplete. In such cases, the organization provides ‘information unavailable/incomplete’ as the reason for omission. For example, information is unavailable for Disclosure 305-3 in GRI 305: Emissions 2016 when the organization has other indirect (Scope 3) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but it has not collected data on its other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions yet.  

When the organization cannot report part of the required information it means the information is incomplete. When the reported information does not cover the complete scope required by a disclosure (e.g., the information is missing for certain entities, sites, geographic locations), then the organization is required to provide ‘information unavailable/incomplete’ as the reason for omission. The organization must specify the entities, sites, geographic locations, etc., for which the required information is missing and cannot be reported.  

The required information, or part of the required information, can be unavailable when, for example, it cannot be obtained or is not of adequate quality to report. This may be the case when the information is collected from another organization, such as a supplier.  

The reasons ‘confidentiality constraints’ and ‘information unavailable/incomplete’ should only be used in exceptional cases. Using ‘confidentiality constraints’ and ‘information unavailable/incomplete’ frequently as reasons for omitting information reduces the credibility and usefulness of the organization’s sustainability reporting. It does not align with the aim of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, which is to provide a comprehensive picture of the organization’s most significant impacts.  

The organization is not allowed to use other reasons for omission than those included in Table 1 of this Standard.  

The organization is required to report reasons for omission in the GRI content index. See Requirement 7 in this Standard for more information on the content index.  

# Requirement 7: Publish a GRI content index  

The organization shall:  

a. publish a GRI content index that includes:  

i. the title: GRI content index;   
ii. the statement of use;   
iii. the title of GRI 1 used;   
iv. the title(s) of the GRI Sector Standard(s) that apply to the organization’s sector(s);   
v. a list of the organization’s material topics;   
vi. a list of the topics in the applicable GRI Sector Standard(s) determined as not material and an explanation for why they are not material;   
vii. a list of the reported disclosures, including the disclosure titles;   
viii. the titles of the GRI Standards and other sources that the reported disclosures come from;   
ix. when the organization does not report GRI Topic Standard disclosures for a material topic from the applicable GRI Sector Standard(s), a list of the disclosures and the required reason for omission;   
x. the GRI Sector Standard reference numbers for the disclosures from the applicable Sector Standard(s);   
xi. the location where the information reported for each disclosure can be found;   
xii. any reasons for omission used;  

b. if it publishes a standalone sustainability report and the GRI content index is not included in the report itself, provide a link or reference to the GRI content index in the report.  

# Guidance  

The information reported using the GRI Standards can be published or made accessible in a range of formats (e.g., electronic, paper-based) across one or more locations (e.g., a standalone sustainability report, web pages, an annual report). The GRI content index provides an overview of the organization’s reported information, shows where the reported information can be found, and helps information users access this information. The content index also shows which GRI Standards and disclosures the organization has used.  

Appendix 1 of this Standard provides guidance on how to prepare the GRI content index when reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. It includes an example that the organization can use to prepare the content index. The organization can use a different format for the content index than the one provided in Appendix 1, as long as it complies with the requirements for the content index.  

# Requirement 8: Provide a statement of use  

a. The organization shall include the following statement in its GRI content index: [Name of organization] has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period [reporting period start and end dates].  

# Guidance  

To state that the organization has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards, the organization must have complied with all nine requirements in this section.  

The organization is required to insert the name of the organization and the start and end dates of its reporting period in the statement, for example:  

‘ABC Limited has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.’  

The organization is required to report whether the highest governance body is responsible for reviewing and approving the reported information, including the organization’s material topics, under Disclosure 2-14 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021.  

# Requirement 9: Notify GRI  

a. The organization shall notify GRI of the use of the GRI Standards and the statement of use by sending an email to reportregistration@globalreporting.org.  

# Guidance  

The organization should include the following information in the email:  

The legal name of the organization.   
The link to the GRI content index.   
The link to the report, if publishing a standalone sustainability report.   
The statement of use.   
A contact person in the organization and their contact details.  

There is no cost associated with notifying GRI of the use of the GRI Standards.  

# Reporting with reference to the GRI Standards  

An organization can report with reference to the GRI Standards if it cannot comply with all the requirements for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization should transition to reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards in time as it will provide a comprehensive picture of the organization’s most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights.  

The organization can also report with reference to the GRI Standards if it uses selected GRI Standards, or parts of their content, to report information about specific topics for specific purposes, such as complying with a reporting regulation on climate change.  

The organization must comply with all three requirements in this section to report with reference to the GRI Standards. The organization should also apply the reporting principles specified in section 4 of this Standard to ensure highquality reporting. Additionally, the organization should explain how it manages its impacts for the topics it reports on using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# Overview of requirements for reporting with reference to the GRI Standards  

Publish a GRI content index Provide a statement of use Notify GRI  

# Publish a GRI content index  

The organization shall:  

a. publish a GRI content index that includes:  

i. the title: GRI content index;   
ii. the statement of use;   
iii. the title of GRI 1 used;   
iv. a list of the reported disclosures from the GRI Standards, including the disclosure titles;   
v. the titles of the GRI Standards that the reported disclosures come from;   
vi. the location where the information reported for each disclosure can be found;  

b. if it publishes a standalone sustainability report and the GRI content index is not included in the report itself, provide a link or reference to the GRI content index in the report.  

# Guidance  

The information reported using the GRI Standards can be published or made accessible in a range of formats (e.g., electronic, paper-based) across one or more locations (e.g., a standalone sustainability report, web pages, an annual report). The GRI content index provides an overview of the organization’s reported information, shows where the reported information can be found, and helps information users access this information. The content index also shows which GRI Standards and disclosures the organization has used.  

Appendix 2 of this Standard provides guidance on how to prepare the GRI content index when reporting with reference to the GRI Standards. It includes an example that the organization can use to prepare the content index. The organization can use a different format for the content index than the one provided in Appendix 2, as long as it complies with the requirements for the content index. The organization can also use the content index specified for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards in Appendix 1 of this Standard, if suitable. In such a case, the statement of use in Appendix 1, which is for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, must be replaced by the statement of use for reporting with reference to the GRI Standards.  

# Provide a statement of use  

a. The organization shall include the following statement in its GRI content index: [Name of organization] has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period [reporting period start and end dates] with reference to the GRI Standards.  

# Guidance  

To state that the organization has reported with reference to the GRI Standards, the organization must have complied with all three requirements in this section.  

The organization is required to insert the name of the organization and the start and end dates of its reporting period in the statement, for example:  

‘ABC Limited has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 with reference to the GRI Standards.’  

# Notify GRI  

a. The organization shall notify GRI of the use of the GRI Standards and the statement of use by sending an email to reportregistration@globalreporting.org.  

# Guidance  

The organization should include the following information in the email:  

The legal name of the organization.   
The link to the GRI content index.   
The link to the report, if publishing a standalone sustainability report.   
The statement of use.   
A contact person in the organization and their contact details.  

There is no cost associated with notifying GRI of the use of the GRI Standards.  

# 4. Reporting principles  

The reporting principles are fundamental to achieving high-quality sustainability reporting. Therefore, an organization is required to apply the reporting principles to be able to claim that it has prepared the reported information in accordance with the GRI Standards (see section 3 in this Standard).  

The reporting principles guide the organization in ensuring the quality and proper presentation of the reported information. High-quality information allows information users to make informed assessments and decisions about the organization’s impacts and its contribution to sustainable development.  

Each reporting principle consists of a requirement and guidance on how to apply it.  

# Overview of principles  

Accuracy   
Balance   
Clarity   
Comparability   
Completeness   
Sustainability context   
Timeliness   
Verifiability  

# Accuracy  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall report information that is correct and sufficiently detailed to allow an assessment of the organization’s impacts.  

# Guidance  

The characteristics that determine accuracy vary depending on the nature of the information (qualitative or quantitative) and the intended use of the information. The accuracy of quantitative information depends on the specific methods used to gather, compile, and analyze data. The accuracy of qualitative information depends on the level of detail and consistency with the available evidence. Information users require sufficient detail to make assessments about the organization’s impacts.  

To apply the Accuracy principle, the organization should:  

report qualitative information that is consistent with available evidence and other reported information; indicate which data has been measured;   
adequately describe data measurements and bases for calculations, and ensure it is possible to replicate measurements and calculations with similar results; ensure that the margin of error for data measurements does not inappropriately influence the conclusions or assessments of information users;   
indicate which data has been estimated, and explain the underlying assumptions and techniques used for the estimation as well as any limitations of the estimates.  

# Balance  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall report information in an unbiased way and provide a fair representation of the organization’s negative and positive impacts.  

# Guidance  

To apply the Balance principle, the organization should:  

present information in a way that allows information users to see negative and positive year-on-year trends in impacts; distinguish clearly between facts and the organization’s interpretation of the facts; not omit relevant information concerning its negative impacts; • not overemphasize positive news or impacts; not present information in a way that is likely to inappropriately influence the conclusions or assessments of information users.  

# Clarity  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall present information in a way that is accessible and understandable.  

# Guidance  

To apply the Clarity principle, the organization should:  

consider specific accessibility needs of information users, associated with abilities, language, and technology; present information in a way that users can find the information they want without unreasonable effort, for example through a table of contents, maps, or links;   
present information in a way that it can be understood by users who have reasonable knowledge of the organization and its activities;   
avoid abbreviations, technical terms, or other jargon likely to be unfamiliar to users or, if these are used, include relevant explanations in the appropriate sections or in a glossary;   
report information in a concise way and aggregate information where useful without omitting necessary details; use graphics and consolidated data tables to make information accessible and understandable.  

# Comparability  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall select, compile, and report information consistently to enable an analysis of changes in the organization’s impacts over time and an analysis of these impacts relative to those of other organizations.  

# Guidance  

Information reported in a comparable way enables the organization and other information users to assess the organization’s current impacts against its past impacts and its goals and targets. It also enables external parties to assess and benchmark the organization’s impacts against impacts of other organizations as part of rating activities, investment decisions, and advocacy programs.  

To apply the Comparability principle, the organization should:  

present information for the current reporting period and at least two previous periods, as well as any goals and targets that have been set;   
use accepted international metrics (e.g., kilograms, liters), and standard conversion factors and protocols, where applicable, for compiling and reporting information;   
maintain consistency in the methods used to measure and calculate data and in explaining the methods and assumptions used;   
maintain consistency in the manner of presenting the information;   
report total numbers or absolute data (e.g., metric tons of $\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ equivalent) as well as ratios or normalized data (e.g., $\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ emissions per unit produced) to enable comparisons, and provide explanatory notes when using ratios; provide contextual information (e.g., the organization’s size, geographic location) to help information users understand the factors that contribute to differences between the organization’s impacts and the impacts of other organizations;   
present the current disclosures alongside restatements of historical data to enable comparisons if there have been changes from the information reported previously. This can include changes in the length of the reporting period, in the measurement methodologies, in the definitions used, or in other elements of reporting. The organization is required to report restatements of information under Disclosure 2-4 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021;   
if restatements of historical data are not provided, explain the changes to provide contextual information for interpreting the current disclosures.  

# Completeness  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall provide sufficient information to enable an assessment of the organization’s impacts during the reporting period.  

# Guidance  

To apply the Completeness principle, the organization should:  

present activities, events, and impacts for the reporting period in which they occur. This includes reporting information about activities that have a minimal impact in the short-term, but a reasonably foreseeable cumulative impact that can become unavoidable or irreversible in the long-term (e.g., activities that generate bio-accumulative or persistent pollutants);   
not omit information that is necessary for understanding the organization’s impacts.  

If the organization consists of multiple entities (i.e., a parent entity and its subordinate entities), the organization is required to explain the approach used for consolidating the information under 2-2-c in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021.  

If the information for a disclosure or a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted is unavailable or incomplete, then the organization is required to provide a reason for omission. When information is incomplete, the organization is required to specify which part is missing (e.g., specify the entities for which the information is missing). See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information.  

# Sustainability context  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall report information about its impacts in the wider context of sustainable development.  

# Guidance  

Sustainable development has been defined as ‘development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ [8]. The objective of sustainability reporting using the GRI Standards is to provide transparency on how an organization contributes or aims to contribute to sustainable development. For this purpose, the organization needs to assess and report information about its impacts in the wider context of sustainable development.  

To apply the Sustainability context principle, the organization should draw on objective information and authoritative measures on sustainable development to report information about its impacts (e.g., scientific research or consensus on the limits and demands placed on environmental resources); report information about its impacts in relation to sustainable development goals and conditions (e.g., reporting total greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions as well as reductions in GHG emissions in relation to the goals set out in the United Nations [UN] Framework Convention on Climate Change [FCCC] Paris Agreement [4]);  

report information about its impacts in relation to societal expectations and expectations of responsible business conduct set out in authoritative intergovernmental instruments with which the organization is expected to comply (e.g., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [3], UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [5]) and in other recognized sector-specific, local, regional, or global instruments;   
if operating in a range of locations, report information about its impacts in relation to appropriate local contexts (e.g., reporting total water use, as well as water use relative to the sustainable thresholds and the social context of given catchments).  

Understanding the sustainability context provides the organization with critical information to determine and report on its material topics (see GRI 3: Material Topics 2021). The GRI Sector Standards describe the sectors’ context and can help the organization understand its sustainability context.  

# Timeliness  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall report information on a regular schedule and make it available in time for information users to make decisions.  

# Guidance  

The usefulness of information is closely tied to whether it is available in time for information users to integrate it into their decision-making. Thus, the Timeliness principle refers to how regularly and how soon after the reporting period the information is published.  

To apply the Timeliness principle, the organization should:  

find a balance between the need to make information available in a timely manner and ensuring that the information is of high quality and meets the requirements under the other reporting principles; ensure consistency in the length of reporting periods;   
indicate the time period covered by the reported information.  

See section 5.1 in this Standard for information on aligning the reporting periods and publishing schedules of sustainability reporting and other types of reporting.  

# Verifiability  

# Requirement  

a. The organization shall gather, record, compile, and analyze information in such a way that the information can be examined to establish its quality.  

# Guidance  

It is important that the reported information can be examined to establish its veracity and to determine the extent to which the reporting principles have been applied.  

To apply the Verifiability principle, the organization should:  

set up internal controls and organize documentation in such a way that individuals other than those preparing the reported information (e.g., internal auditors, external assurance providers) can review them;   
document the decision-making processes underlying the organization’s sustainability reporting in a way that allows for the examination of the key decisions and processes, such as the process of determining material topics;   
if the organization designs information systems for its sustainability reporting, design these systems in a way that they can be examined as part of an external assurance process;   
be able to identify the original sources of the reported information and provide reliable evidence to support assumptions or calculations;  

be able to provide representation from the original sources of the reported information attesting to the accuracy of the information within acceptable margins of error; avoid including information that is not substantiated by evidence unless it is relevant for understanding the organization’s impacts; provide clear explanations of any uncertainties associated with the reported information.  

See section 5.2 in this Standard for more information on enhancing the credibility of the organization’s sustainability reporting.  

# 5. Additional recommendations for reporting  

This section presents recommendations for an organization to align its sustainability reporting with other types of reporting and to enhance the credibility of its sustainability reporting.  

# 5.1 Aligning sustainability reporting with other reporting  

An organization should align its sustainability reporting with other statutory and regulatory reporting, in particular its financial reporting. This means that the organization should report the information for the same reporting period and for the same group of entities as covered in its financial reporting. The organization should also publish the information at the same time as its financial reporting, where this is possible.  

# 5.2 Enhancing the credibility of sustainability reporting  

There are several ways in which an organization can enhance the credibility of its sustainability reporting. These include the use of internal controls, external assurance, and stakeholder or expert panels. The organization is not required to apply these methods when reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards but is encouraged to do so.  

# Internal controls  

The organization should set up internal controls to strengthen the integrity and credibility of its sustainability reporting. Internal controls are processes designed and implemented by the organization, generally its management, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of its objectives.  

Internal controls can be implemented in day-to-day operations and through compliance functions. The organization can also establish and maintain an internal audit function as part of its processes for risk management to further improve the credibility of its sustainability reporting.  

In some jurisdictions, corporate governance codes require the highest governance body to inquire and, if it is satisfied, to confirm the adequacy of an organization’s internal controls in the annual report. This confirmation may only relate to the adequacy of the internal controls for financial reporting. It may not provide information about whether the same internal controls are also adequate to assess the credibility of the organization’s sustainability reporting. If the organization relies on internal controls set up for financial reporting, it should assess the relevance of these controls for its sustainability reporting. In cases where these controls are inadequate, the organization should identify and use additional internal controls to assess the credibility of its sustainability reporting.  

# External assurance  

In addition to internal controls, the organization should seek external assurance for its sustainability reporting. Disclosure 2-5 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires the organization to describe its policy and practice for seeking external assurance for its sustainability reporting. If the sustainability reporting has been externally assured, the organization is also required to describe what was assured and on what basis.  

External assurance comprises activities carried out by assurance providers to assess the quality and credibility of the qualitative and quantitative information reported by the organization. External assurance can also be used to assess the organization's systems or processes to prepare the information (e.g., the process of determining material topics). External assurance is different from activities used to assess or validate the performance, such as compliance assessments or the issuing of performance certifications.  

External assurance results in published assurance reports or conclusions that can be used to verify that the information has been prepared in accordance with reporting standards. It can also be used to reduce risk in data quality and increase trust in the reported information. This, in turn, helps information users and the organization rely on the reported information for their decision-making.  

External assurance should be conducted by competent assurance providers with appropriate experience and qualifications. Assurance providers should be:  

independent from the organization and therefore able to reach impartial and objective conclusions about the organization’s reporting and to publish these conclusions in a report that is publicly available; demonstrably competent in the subject matter and assurance practices;  

competent in applying quality control procedures to the assurance engagement;   
able to conduct the engagement in a manner that is systematic, documented, evidence-based, and characterized by defined procedures in line with professional standards for assurance;   
able to consider the selection of the information reported as well as its accuracy, and to assess whether the reporting provides a comprehensive picture of the organization’s most significant impacts and how it manages these impacts;   
able to assess the extent to which the organization has applied the GRI Standards in formulating opinions or reaching conclusions.  

# Stakeholder or expert panels  

The organization can also convene a stakeholder or expert panel to seek views on its approach to sustainability reporting or for advice on the information to be reported.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Guidance  

This Appendix provides guidance on how to prepare the GRI content index when reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. It includes an example that the organization can use to prepare the content index. The organization can use a different format for the content index than the one provided here, as long as it complies with the requirements for the content index specified in Requirement 7 in this Standard.  

The organization can include additional information in the content index, beyond what is required by the GRI Standards. For example, the organization can show how the disclosures it has reported using the GRI Standards are related to those required by other reporting standards or frameworks.  

The organization should make sure that such additions do not compromise the readability of the content index. This can be done by providing any additional information in separate columns or rows that are included at the end of the content index, after all the required information has been specified.  

The organization should not report the information required by the disclosures directly in the content index. Exceptions can be made if the information is brief and easier to find in the content index than in other locations (e.g., information on the reporting period may be easier to find when stated directly in the content index); or to report that an item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) specified in a disclosure does not exist. Detailed reporting in the content index should be avoided.

# Statement of use  

The organization is required to include in the GRI content index the statement of use for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, as specified in Requirement 7-a-ii in this Standard. See Requirement 8 in this Standard for more information on the statement of use.  

# GRI 1 used  

The organization is required to include in the GRI content index the title of GRI 1 it has used, as specified in Requirement 7-a-iii in this Standard. The title of GRI 1 includes the number, name, and publication year (e.g., GRI 1: Foundation 2021).  

GRI 1 does not contain disclosures, but it does specify the requirements for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. The GRI Standards are regularly updated, and a newer version of GRI 1 may have different requirements for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards than its previous version. Indicating which version of GRI 1 the organization has used helps clarify which requirements it must comply with.  

# Applicable GRI Sector Standard(s)  

The organization is required to include in the GRI content index the titles of the GRI Sector Standards that apply to its sectors, as specified in Requirement 7-a-iv in this Standard. The title of a GRI Sector Standard includes the number, name, and publication year (e.g., GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021).  

![](images/f55a9439701113be65f2b0245a34b3563f0f72a3b1b6d19d1bd60aa97ae1618d.jpg)  

# Titles of the GRI Standards and other sources of reported disclosures  

The organization is required to include in the GRI content index the titles of the GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards it has used to report disclosures, as specified in Requirement 7-a-viii in this Standard. These include:  

• GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021;   
• GRI 3: Material Topics 2021;   
• the Topic Standards the organization has used for reporting on its material topics;   
• the Sector Standards the organization has used to report additional sector disclosures listed for its material topics.  

The title of a GRI Standard includes the number, name, and publication year (e.g., GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018).  

The publication year indicates which version of a GRI Standard the organization has used. The GRI Standards are regularly updated, and a newer version of a GRI Standard may have different disclosures than its previous version. The publication year of the Standard does not refer to the reporting period covered by the reported information or to the year that the reported information is published.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">If the organization reports disclosures from other sources, the organization is require</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>to include in the content index the titles of the sources it has used. Disclosures The organization is required to list in the GRl content index all the disclosures it has</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>reported, as specified in Requirement 7-a-vi in this Standard. These include the disclosures from GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 and GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, and the disclosures it has reported for each material topic. For each material topic the organization is required to list the disclosures it has reported from the GRI Topic Standards and GRI Sector Standards, as well as the disclosures it has reported from other sources. The organization should organize these disclosures by each material topic. See Requirement 5-a and Requirement 5-b in this Standard for more information on reporting disclosures for each material topic. Besides the disclosures from the Topic Standards, the Sector Standards may list additional sector disclosures for organizations to report. Reporting these additional sector disclosures is a recommendation. If the organization reports any of these additional sector disclosures for its material topics, it is required to list them in the content index. The organization is required to include the disclosure titles in the content index. The title of a disclosure includes the number and name (e.g., 2-6 Activities, value chain an other business relationships). For disclosures from other sources, if there is no disclosure title available, the organization can list any other information that helps identify the disclosure. GRI Topic Standards disclosures listed in the applicable GRI Sector Standards that are not reported For each topic in the applicable GRI Sector Standards determined as material, the organization is required to include in the GRI content index any GRI Topic Standards disclosures listed for that topic that the organization does not report, as specified in Requirement 7-a-ix in this Standard. There can be cases where a Topic Standard disclosure listed in the Sector Standard not relevant to the organization's impacts in relation to the material topic. In such cases, the organization is required to provide the 'not applicable' reason for omission and to briefly explain why the disclosure is not relevant. See Requirement 5-b in this </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Standard for more information on reporting on material topics covered in the Sector Standards. Location For each disclosure that it has reported, the organization is required to include in the GRI content index the location (i.e., the specific page numbers or links) in, for example a report, document, website where the information can be found, as specified in Requirement 7-a-xi in this Standard. If the information reported for a disclosure is spread across multiple pages or web pages, the organization is required to specify a page numbers and links across which the information is distributed. If the organization is required to report information that it has previously reported, and the information has not changed during the reporting period (e.g., the organization is required to report information about a policy or process that has not changed since th previous reporting period), the organization can republish this information or provide a reference to the previously reported information in the content index.</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Omissions  

The organization is required to include in the GRI content index the reasons for omission it has used for each disclosure or requirement it cannot comply with, as specified in Requirement 7-a-xii in this Standard.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted, the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with in the content index. It is also required to provide one of the permitted reasons for omission and the required explanation for that reason. The four permitted reasons for omission are: not applicable, legal prohibitions, confidentiality constraints, and information unavailable/incomplete. See Requirement 6 in this Standard for more information on reasons for omission.

# GRI Sector Standard reference numbers  

When listing the GRI disclosures and additional sector disclosures from the applicable GRI Sector Standards in the GRI content index, the organization is required to include the GRI Sector Standard reference numbers, as specified in Requirement $7-a-x$ in this Standard. The GRI Sector Standard reference number refers to the unique identifier for each disclosure listed in a Sector Standard (e.g., S11.1.1). This identifier helps information users assess which of the disclosures listed in the Sector Standards are included in the organization’s reporting.  

# Material topics  

The organization is required to list its material topics in the GRI content index, as specified in Requirement 7-a-v in this Standard.  

![](images/bbdb10b50a85eeff49d727cf5f78e3421b515da7b82351f06bcfae79f24cba1b.jpg)  

The list of material topics included in the content index is the same as the list of material topics reported under 3-2-a in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

![](images/888b699f66d0450c66d246c2ec4c8aa69c1a32945ed32a6fe92ae77eb52f12fc.jpg)  

Topics in the applicable GRI Sector Standards determined as not material The organization is required to list in the GRI content index any topics from the applicable GRI Sector Standards that it has determined as not material and explain why they are not material, as specified in Requirement 7-a-vi in this Standard. See Requirement 3-b in this Standard for more information on using the Sector Standards to determine material topics.

# Guidance  

This Appendix provides guidance on how to prepare the GRI content index when reporting with reference to the GRI Standards. It includes an example that the organization can use to prepare the content index. The organization can use a different format for the content index than the one provided here, as long as it complies with the requirements for the content index specified in ‘Reporting with reference to the GRI Standards’ at the end of section 3 of this Standard. The organization can also use the content index specified for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards in Appendix 1, if suitable. In such a case, the statement of use in Appendix 1, which is for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, must be replaced by the statement of use for reporting with reference to the GRI Standards.  

The organization can include additional information in the content index, beyond what is required by the GRI Standards. For example, the organization can show how the disclosures it has reported using the GRI Standards are related to those required by other reporting standards or frameworks.

# Introduction  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures for organizations to provide information about their reporting practices; activities and workers; governance; strategy, policies, and practices; and stakeholder engagement. This information gives insight into the profile and scale of organizations and provides a context for understanding their impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains five disclosures, which provide information about the organization, its sustainability reporting practices, and the entities included in its sustainability reporting.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s activities, employees, and other workers.   
Section 3 contains thirteen disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s governance structure, composition, roles, and remuneration.   
Section 4 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s sustainable development strategy and its policies and practices for responsible business conduct.   
Section 5 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s stakeholder engagement practices and how it engages in collective bargaining with employees.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard, as well as resources that the organization can consult.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report all disclosures in this Standard.   
Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard requires the organization to list its entities included in its sustainability reporting.   
These entities define the scope for reporting all other disclosures in this Standard.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for all disclosures in this Standard except for:  

Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details   
Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability reporting   
Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point   
Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information   
Disclosure 2-5 External assurance  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for omission are permitted (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout the GRI Standards:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. The organization and its reporting practices  

The disclosures in this section provide an overview of the organization, its sustainability reporting practices, and the entities included in its sustainability reporting.  

# Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. report its legal name;   
b. report its nature of ownership and legal form;   
c. report the location of its headquarters;   
d. report its countries of operation.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance to 2-1-a  

If the organization uses a commonly known trading name or business name that is different from its legal name, it should report this in addition to its legal name.  

# Guidance to 2-1-b  

The nature of ownership and the legal form of the organization refers to whether it is publicly or privately owned, and whether it is an incorporated entity, a partnership, a sole proprietorship, or another type of entity such as a nonprofit, an association, or a charity.  

# Guidance to 2-1-c  

Headquarters are an organization’s global administrative center, the place from which it is controlled or directed.  

# Guidance to 2-1-d  

If the organization has reported its countries of operation elsewhere, such as in its audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, the organization can provide a link or reference to this information. The organization can also report the regions or specific locations within countries (e.g., states, cities) where it has operations, if this provides contextual information for understanding the organization’s impacts.  

# Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability reporting  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. list all its entities included in its sustainability reporting;  

b. if the organization has audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, specify the differences between the list of entities included in its financial reporting and the list included in its sustainability reporting; if the organization consists of multiple entities, explain the approach used for consolidating the information, including: i. whether the approach involves adjustments to information for minority interests; ii. how the approach takes into account mergers, acquisitions, and disposal of entities or parts of entities; iii. whether and how the approach differs across the disclosures in this Standard an across material topics.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance to 2-2-a  

The entities reported under 2-2-a form the basis for reporting the disclosures in this Standard and for determining the organization’s material topics.  

Requirement 2-2-a includes those entities that the organization controls or has an interest in and are included in its sustainability reporting, such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliates, including minority interests. The organization should report information for the same group of entities as covered in its financial reporting.  

When determining its material topics, the organization should consider the impacts of additional entities with which it has business relationships that are not included in the list reported under 2-2-a. See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information.  

# Guidance to 2-2-a and 2-2-b  

If all the entities in the organization’s financial reporting are also included in its sustainability reporting, a brief statement of this fact, including a link or reference to the list of entities included in its audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, is sufficient to comply with 2-2-a and 2-2-b.  

The organization should separately specify any additional entities included in the sustainability reporting that are not included in its financial reporting.  

# Guidance to 2-2-c  

A minority interest is an ownership interest in an entity that is not controlled by the parent entity.  

# Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. specify the reporting period for, and the frequency of, its sustainability reporting;   
b. specify the reporting period for its financial reporting and, if it does not align with the period for its sustainability reporting, explain the reason for this;   
c. report the publication date of the report or reported information;   
d. specify the contact point for questions about the report or reported information.  

# GUIDANCE  

Guidance to 2-3-a The organization can specify the frequency of sustainability reporting as ‘annual’. See th Timeliness principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.  

# Guidance to 2-3-a and 2-3-b  

The reporting period refers to the time period covered by the reported information and should include the start and end dates (e.g., 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, 1 July 2022 through 30 June 2023).  

The organization should report the information for the same reporting period as covered in its financial reporting. The organization should also publish the information at the same time as its financial reporting, where this is possible.  

# Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. report restatements of information made from previous reporting periods and explain:  

i. the reasons for the restatements;   
ii. the effect of the restatements.  

# GUIDANCE  

The organization should provide a restatement of information when it has learned that the previously reported information needs to be revised. Restatements of information from previous reporting periods can correct an error, or account for changes in measurement methodology or to the nature of the business. Restatements of information ensure consistency and enable comparability of information between reporting periods. See the Comparability principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.  

The organization should report the criteria used to determine when a change or error in previously reported information is considered significant enough to provide a restatement. A change or error could be significant when it influences information users’ decision-making (e.g., it influences the analysis of the changes in the organization’s impacts over time).  

For example, if an organization adopts a new, more accurate method for measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it may subsequently experience a reduction in its previously reported GHG emissions that meets the organization’s restatement criteria. The organization then restates its previously reported GHG emissions. In such a case, the organization is required to explain that it has restated its previously reported GHG emissions due to the new measurement methodology and that this has resulted in lower GHG emissions than previously reported. The organization should also report the quantitative change observed (e.g., GHG emissions are $10\%$ lower than the emissions previously reported).  

If the organization has not made any restatement in the reporting period, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.  

# Guidance to 2-4-a-i  

Examples of reasons for restatements of information include:  

change of base period or length of the reporting period;   
change in the nature of the business;   
change in the measurement methodologies or in the definitions used;   
disposals, mergers, or acquisitions;   
error made in previous reporting periods.  

# Guidance to 2-4-a-ii  

The effect of the restatement refers to the consequences of the change or correction made to previously reported information. If the restatement relates to quantitative information, the organization should specify the quantitative change in the restated information (e.g., GHG emissions are $10\%$ lower compared to the level of emissions previously reported).  

# Disclosure 2-5 External assurance  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. describe its policy and practice for seeking external assurance, including whether and how the highest governance body and senior executives are involved;   
b. if the organization’s sustainability reporting has been externally assured: i. provide a link or reference to the external assurance report(s) or assurance statement(s); ii. describe what has been assured and on what basis, including the assurance standards used, the level of assurance obtained, and any limitations of the assurance process; iii. describe the relationship between the organization and the assurance provider.  

# GUIDANCE  

See section 5.2 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for information on external assurance.  

# Guidance to 2-5-b-ii  

If this information is covered in the external assurance reports or statements that the organization has provided a link or a reference to under 2-5-b-i, then a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.  

The organization can also describe, in accessible language:  

the scope of information and processes covered;   
the responsibilities of the organization relative to the assurance provider;   
the opinion or conclusions formally signed off by the assurance provider;   
a summary of the work performed;   
information on the experience and qualifications of the assurance provider, e.g., profile and level of subject matter expertise of the individuals involved.  

# Guidance to 2-5-b-iii  

An assurance provider conducting external assurance needs to demonstrate independence from the organization to reach and publish objective and impartial conclusions about the organization’s sustainability reporting.  

# 2. Activities and workers  

The disclosures in this section provide an overview of the organization’s activities, employees, and other workers.  

# Disclosure 2-6 Activities, value chain and other business relationships  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. report the sector(s) in which it is active;   
b. describe its value chain, including: i. the organization’s activities, products, services, and markets served; ii. the organization’s supply chain; iii. the entities downstream from the organization and their activities;   
c. report other relevant business relationships;   
d. describe significant changes in 2-6-a, 2-6-b, and 2-6-c compared to the previous reporting period.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance to 2-6-a  

Sectors can be identified according to categories, such as the public or private sector; or industry-specific categories, such as the education sector or the financial sector.  

Depending on the organization’s activities, sectors can be identified using the GRI Sector Standards or classification systems such as the Global Industry Classification Standard $(\mathsf{G}|\mathsf{C S}\mathbb{\otimes})$ , the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), and the Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS®).  

# Guidance to 2-6-b  

The organization’s value chain includes the range of activities carried out by the organization, and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization, to bring the organization’s products or services from their conception to their end use. Entities upstream from the organization provide products or services used in the development of the organization’s own products or services. Entities downstream from the organization are those that receive products or services from the organization. Entities in the value chain include entities beyond the first tier, both upstream and downstream.  

The information reported under 2-6-b provides a context for understanding the organization’s impacts across its value chain, including through the use of its products and services. Describing the markets served provides further information on the groups of customers targeted by the organization’s products and services.  

The organization is not required to provide a detailed description of each activity in its value chain. Instead, it can provide a high-level overview of its value chain.  

# Guidance to 2-6-b-i  

When describing its activities, the organization should report its total number of operations and explain how it defines ‘operation’.  

When describing its products and services, the organization should report:  

the quantity of products or services provided during the reporting period (e.g., number of products or services provided, net sales of products or services provided); whether it sells products or services that are banned in certain markets or are the subject of stakeholder concerns or public debate, including the reason for the ban or concerns and how the organization has responded to these concerns.  

When describing the markets served, the organization can report:  

the geographic locations where products and services are offered;   
the demographic or other characteristics of the markets;   
information on the size and relative importance of the markets (e.g., net sales, net revenues).  

# Guidance to 2-6-b-ii  

The organization can describe:  

• the types of suppliers (e.g., brokers, contractors, wholesalers);   
• the estimated number of suppliers throughout its supply chain and in each tier (e.g., first tier, second tier); the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by its suppliers (e.g., manufacturing, providing consulting services); the nature of its business relationships with its suppliers (e.g., long-term or short-term, contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based); the sector-specific characteristics of its supply chain (e.g., labor-intensive); the estimated monetary value of payments made to its suppliers; the geographic location of its suppliers.  

# Guidance to 2-6-b-iii  

The organization can describe:  

the types of downstream entities (e.g., customers, beneficiaries); • the estimated number of downstream entities; the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by the downstream entities (e.g., manufacturing, wholesale, retail); the nature of its business relationships with the downstream entities (e.g., long-term or short-term, contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based); the geographic location of the downstream entities.  

# Guidance to 2-6-c  

Other relevant business relationships include relationships that the organization has with entities that are not described as part of its value chain under 2-6-b. These may include business partners (e.g., joint ventures) and other entities directly linked to the organization’s operations, products, or services (for examples, see the note in the definition of ‘business relationships’).  

The organization can report the types of entities, their activities, and their geographic location.  

# Guidance to 2-6-d  

Requirement 2-6-d entails describing significant changes in the organization’s sectors, value chain, and other business relationships compared to the previous reporting period. This information can help explain changes to the organization’s impacts. Examples of significant changes that can be reported under this disclosure are changes in activities such as the opening, closing, or expansion of facilities; changes in the structure of the organization’s supply chain or in its relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination; or changes in the location of its suppliers.  

# Disclosure 2-7 Employees  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. report the total number of employees, and a breakdown of this total by gender and by region;  

b. report the total number of:  

i. permanent employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;   
ii. temporary employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;   
iii. non-guaranteed hours employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;   
iv. full-time employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;   
v. part-time employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;  

c. describe the methodologies and assumptions used to compile the data, including whether the numbers are reported:  

i. in head count, full-time equivalent (FTE), or using another methodology; ii. at the end of the reporting period, as an average across the reporting period, or using another methodology;   
d. report contextual information necessary to understand the data reported under 2-7-a and 2-7-b;   
e. describe significant fluctuations in the number of employees during the reporting period and between reporting periods.  

# GUIDANCE  

Together with Disclosure 2-8, this disclosure gives insight into the organization’s approach to employment, including the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures, and serves as the basis for calculation in other disclosures, such as Disclosure 2-21 Annual total compensation ratio and Disclosure 2-30 Collective bargaining agreements in this Standard.  

This disclosure covers all employees who perform work for any of the organization’s entities included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard.  

See references [7], [19], [22], [23], [24], [26], and [30] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance to 2-7-a  

An employee is an individual who is in an employment relationship with the organization according to national law or practice.  

Providing a breakdown of employees by gender gives insight into gender representation across the organization. Providing a breakdown of employees by region gives insight into regional variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such as a city or a world region.  

See Table 1 and Table 2 of this Standard for examples of how to present this information.  

# Guidance to 2-7-b  

The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees differ between countries. If the organization has employees in more than one country, it should use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data should then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions.  

Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the organization without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the organization is not contractually obligated to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fall under this category.  

If the organization is unable to report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than 1,000, to the nearest 100, and explain this under 2-7-c.  

See Table 1 and Table 2 of this Standard for examples of how to present this information.  

# Guidance to 2-7-c  

The organization can report the total number of employees and the number of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees in head count or full-time equivalent (FTE). Reporting these numbers in head count gives insight into the number of individual employees, whether full-time or part-time employed. Reporting these numbers in FTE gives insight into the hours worked.  

The organization can use another methodology for reporting these numbers.  

Reporting the number of employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.  

# Guidance to 2-7-d  

Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the organization is required to report contextual information to help information users interpret the data.  

The organization can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice to offer a temporary contract (e.g., six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The organization can also explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.  

The organization can explain how it defines full-time employment. If the organization has employees in more than one country, it can report the definitions of full-time employment it uses for the regions that cover these countries. The organization can also explain the reasons for part-time employment. Examples of such reasons are to accommodate employees’ requests to work reduced hours, or because the organization is unable to provide full-time employment to all employees.  

If there are differences in permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employment between genders or between regions, the organization can explain the reasons for these differences.  

# Guidance to 2-7-e  

Requirement 2-7-e enables the organization to explain how the numbers of employees vary during the reporting period compared to the previous reporting periods (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.  

It is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of employees it considers significant to report under 2-7-e. The organization should report its threshold for determining significant fluctuations.  

If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of employees during the reporting period or between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.

# Disclosure 2-8 Workers who are not employees  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. report the total number of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization and describe:  

i. the most common types of worker and their contractual relationship with the organization;   
ii. the type of work they perform;  

b. describe the methodologies and assumptions used to compile the data, including whether the number of workers who are not employees is reported:  

i. in head count, full-time equivalent (FTE), or using another methodology; ii. at the end of the reporting period, as an average across the reporting period, or using another methodology;  

c. describe significant fluctuations in the number of workers who are not employees during the reporting period and between reporting periods.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure provides an understanding of how much the organization relies on workers who are not employees to perform its work, in comparison to employees. This information is important for understanding how many workers in total perform work for the organization, because workers who are not employees are not represented in employment figures reported under Disclosure 2-7.  

Disclosure 2-8, together with Disclosure 2-7, gives insight into the organization’s approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures.  

This disclosure covers all workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by any of the organization’s entities included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard.  

If all the workers performing work for the organization are employees and the organization does not have any workers who are not employees, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirements under this disclosure.  

See references [7], [19], [22], [23], [24], [26], and [30] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance to 2-8-a  

Workers who are not employees are those who perform work for the organization but are not in an employment relationship with the organization.  

This disclosure requires the organization to report the number of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization. Control of work implies that the organization directs the work performed or has control over the means or methods for performing the work.  

The organization might have sole control of the work or share control with one or more organizations (e.g., suppliers, customers, or other business partners, such as in joint ventures). Types of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization include agency workers, apprentices, contractors, home workers, interns, self-employed persons, sub-contractors, and volunteers. The organization should report how it has determined when it has control of the work for workers who are not employees.  

The following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization. The following workers are included under this disclosure:  

Contractors hired by the organization to perform work at the organization’s workplace, in a public area (e.g., on a road), or directly at the workplace of the organization’s client. Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, where the organization instructs the supplier to use particular materials or work methods to manufacture the products or deliver the  

services.  

Volunteers or interns performing work for the organization.  

The following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is not controlled by the organization. The following workers are not included under this disclosure:  

Workers of an equipment supplier to the organization who perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (e.g., photocopy machines at the organization’s workplace) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the organization. Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, if the organization sources standard products manufactured using the supplier’s production methods (e.g., purchasing stationery that is a standard product of the supplier).  

If the organization cannot report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of workers who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of workers who are not employees is greater than 1,000, to the nearest 100, and explain this under 2-8-b.  

# Guidance to 2-8-a-i and 2-8-a-ii  

When reporting its contractual relationship with the most common types of workers, the organization should report whether it engages them directly or indirectly through a third party, and in the latter case, who this third party is (e.g., employment agency, contractor).  

It is sufficient that the organization provides a general description. The organization is not required to report the type of worker, contractual relationship, and work performed for every worker who is not an employee.  

# Guidance to $2-8-b$  

The organization can report the number of workers who are not employees in head count or fulltime equivalent (FTE). The head count gives insight into the number of individual workers, whether on a full-time or part-time basis. The FTE gives insight into the hours worked. The organization can use another methodology for reporting this number.  

Reporting the number of workers who are not employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time  without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting this number as an average across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.  

# Guidance to 2-8-c  

Requirement 2-8-c enables the organization to explain how the number of workers who are not employees varies during the reporting period or compared to previous reporting periods (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of workers who are not employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of workers who are not employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.  

It is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of workers it considers significant to report under 2-8-c. The organization should report its threshold for determining significant fluctuations.  

If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of workers who are not employees during the reporting period or between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.  

# 3. Governance  

The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s governance structure, composition, knowledge, roles, and remuneration.  

The information reported under these disclosures is important for understanding how the management of the organization’s impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, is integrated into the organization’s strategy and operations. It addresses how the governance bodies are set up and how well equipped they are to oversee the management of the organization’s impacts. It also facilitates an understanding of the role and the responsibilities of governance bodies with respect to these impacts.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).

b. report the ratio of the percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization’s highest-paid individual to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees (excluding the highest-paid individual);   
c. report contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance to 2-21-a and 2-21-b  

This disclosure covers all employees as reported under Disclosure 2-7 in this Standard.  

Annual total compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value, and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings provided over the course of a year. When calculating the ratio, the organization should, depending on the organization’s remuneration policies and availability of data, consider all of the following:  

Base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and non-variable cash compensation.   
Total cash compensation, which is the sum of the base salary and cash allowances, bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and other forms of variable cash payments.   
Direct compensation, which is the sum of total cash compensation and total fair value of all annual long-term incentives (e.g., stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units, performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock appreciation rights, and long-term cash awards).  

The annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Annual total compensation for the organization's highest paid-individual</td></tr><tr><td>Median annual total compensation for all of the organization's employees excluding the highest-paid individual</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The change in the annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid individual</td></tr><tr><td>Median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all of the organization's employees excluding the highest-paid individual</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Guidance to 2-21-c  

Quantitative data, such as the annual total compensation ratio, may not be sufficient on its own to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size of the organization (e.g., revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy (e.g., reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or currency volatility.  

The difference in pay disparity reported over the years may be the result of a change in the organization’s compensation policy or the level of compensation for its highest-paid individual or employees, a change in calculation methodology (e.g., selection of the median annual total compensation, inclusions or exclusions) or an improvement in data collection processes. For this reason, the organization is required to report contextual information to help information users interpret the data and understand how it has been compiled.  

The organization should provide the following contextual information:  

Whether any employees reported under Disclosure 2-7 in this Standard have been excluded.   
Whether full-time equivalent (FTE) pay rates are used for each part-time employee.   
A list of the types of compensation included.   
The title of the highest-paid individual.  

# 4. Strategy, policies and practices  

The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s sustainable development strategy and its policies and practices for responsible business conduct. The disclosures are based on expectations for businesses contained in authoritative intergovernmental instruments.1  

Expectations for responsible business conduct include complying with laws and regulations, respecting all internationally recognized human rights, including workers' rights, and protecting the environment and public health and safety. The expectations also cover combating bribery, bribe solicitation, extortion, and other forms of corruption; adhering to good tax practices; and conducting due diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how the organization addresses its negative impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights.  

In the disclosures in this section, the organization is required to report information about its overall policies and practices for responsible business conduct, rather than information for specific material topics. Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 requires information about how the organization manages each material topic. If the organization has described its policies and practices for a material topic under the disclosures in this section, it can provide a reference to this information under Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3 and does not need to repeat the information.  

# Disclosure 2-22 Statement on sustainable development strategy  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. report a statement from the highest governance body or most senior executive of the organization about the relevance of sustainable development to the organization and its strategy for contributing to sustainable development.  

# GUIDANCE  

The organization should describe:  

its short, medium, and long-term vision and strategy to manage its impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, across the organization’s activities and business relationships;   
how its purpose, business strategy, and business model aim to prevent negative impacts and achieve positive impacts on the economy, environment, and people;   
its short and medium-term strategic priorities for contributing to sustainable development, including how the priorities are aligned with authoritative intergovernmental instruments; the broader trends (e.g., macroeconomic, social, political) affecting the organization and its strategy for contributing to sustainable development;   
the key events, achievements, and failures associated with the organization’s contribution to sustainable development during the reporting period;   
a view of performance against goals and targets related to the organization’s material topics during the reporting period;   
the organization’s main challenges, goals, and targets regarding its contribution to   
sustainable development for the next year and the coming three to five years.  

# Disclosure 2-23 Policy commitments  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. describe its policy commitments for responsible business conduct, including:  

i. the authoritative intergovernmental instruments that the commitments reference;   
ii. whether the commitments stipulate conducting due diligence;   
iii. whether the commitments stipulate applying the precautionary principle;   
iv. whether the commitments stipulate respecting human rights;  

b. describe its specific policy commitment to respect human rights, including:  

i. the internationally recognized human rights that the commitment covers; ii. the categories of stakeholders, including at-risk or vulnerable groups, that the organization gives particular attention to in the commitment;  

c. provide links to the policy commitments if publicly available, or, if the policy commitments are not publicly available, explain the reason for this;  

d. report the level at which each of the policy commitments was approved within the organization, including whether this is the most senior level;  

e. report the extent to which the policy commitments apply to the organization’s activities and to its business relationships;  

f. describe how the policy commitments are communicated to workers, business partners, and other relevant parties.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure covers the organization’s policy commitments for responsible business conduct, including the commitment to respect human rights. These commitments can be set out in a stand-alone policy document or be included within one or more other policy documents, such as codes of conduct.  

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [12], the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [11], and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14] set out expectations for organizations in relation to these policy commitments.  

# Guidance to 2-23-a  

The organization should report the expectations, values, principles, and norms of behavior set out in the policy commitments.  

The organization can also report how the policy commitments were developed, including the internal and external expertise that informed the policy commitments.  

# Guidance to 2-23-a-i  

See the Bibliography for a list of authoritative intergovernmental instruments for responsible business conduct.  

The organization can also make a reference to other standards or initiatives that it participates in.  

# Guidance to 2-23-a-iii  

The precautionary principle is set out in Principle 15 of the UN Rio Declaration on Environment and Development [18]. It states: ‘Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.’  

The precautionary principle means taking early action to prevent and mitigate potential negative impacts in situations where conclusive scientific understanding or evidence is lacking, but there is sufficient reason to expect serious or irreversible damage.  

While the precautionary principle is most often associated with the protection of the environment, it can be applied to other areas, such as health and safety. The organization can describe the areas where it applies the precautionary principle.  

The application of the precautionary principle can be reported under 3-3-d-i in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, as part of the organization’s actions to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts for each material topic.  

# Guidance to 2-23-b-i  

Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings and are all interrelated, interdependent, and indivisible.  

The internationally recognized human rights include, at a minimum, the rights set out in the UN International Bill of Human Rights [15] and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work [5]. The UN International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.  

Other UN instruments elaborate further on the rights of indigenous peoples; women; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; children; persons with disabilities; and migrant workers and their families. There are also standards of international humanitarian law that apply in situations of armed conflict, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Geneva Conventions of 1949 [1].2  

At the regional level, binding treaties as well as non-binding instruments provide region-specific frameworks for human rights.3  

If the policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human rights, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement. The organization can also state if the policy commitment references certain rights that require particular attention. For example, an organization can state that its policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human rights, and also references the rights to privacy and freedom of expression in particular because the organization has identified that its activities have an impact on these rights.  

If the policy commitment covers only some internationally recognized human rights, the organization is required to state the rights that are covered. It can explain why the policy commitment is limited to these rights.  

# Guidance to 2-23-b-ii  

Categories of stakeholders that the organization gives particular attention to can include consumers, customers, employees and other workers, and local communities. They can also include individuals belonging to groups or populations that are considered to be at risk or vulnerable groups, such as children; human rights defenders; indigenous peoples; migrant workers and their families; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; persons who might be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics; persons with disabilities; or women.  

For example, a bank may give particular attention in its policy commitment to avoid discriminating against specific categories of customers, or a mining organization may give particular attention to avoid infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples.  

# Guidance to 2-23-d  

The most senior level may differ between organizations. For example, the most senior level in an organization could be the highest governance body (e.g., the board) or the most senior executive (e.g., chief executive officer).  

The organization can also report the dates of approval and adoption of the policy commitments, and how frequently the commitments are reviewed.  

# Guidance to 2-23-e  

If the policy commitments apply to all of the organization’s activities and business relationships equally, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.  

If the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s activities (e.g., they apply only to entities located in certain countries or to certain subsidiaries), the organization should report which activities the commitments apply to. It can also explain why the commitments are limited to these activities.  

If the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s business relationships, the organization should specify the types of business relationships the commitments apply to (e.g., distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). It can also explain why the commitments are limited to these business relationships. The organization should also explain whether the business relationships are obligated to abide by the policy commitments or are encouraged (but not obligated) to do so.  

# Guidance to 2-23-f  

The organization can report:  

whether the policy commitments need to be read, agreed to, and regularly signed by all workers, business partners, and other relevant parties, such as governance body members; the means through which it communicates the policy commitments (e.g., newsletters, formal or informal meetings, dedicated websites, contractual agreements); how it identifies and removes potential barriers to the communication or dissemination of the policy commitments (e.g., by making them accessible and available in relevant languages).  

# Disclosure 2-24 Embedding policy commitments  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. describe how it embeds each of its policy commitments for responsible business conduct throughout its activities and business relationships, including:  

i. how it allocates responsibility to implement the commitments across different levels within the organization;   
ii. how it integrates the commitments into organizational strategies, operational policies, and operational procedures;   
iii. how it implements its commitments with and through its business relationships;   
iv. training that the organization provides on implementing the commitments.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure gives insight into how the organization embeds its policy commitments for responsible business conduct, including the commitment to respect human rights, throughout its activities and business relationships. This ensures that people at all levels act responsibly and with awareness of and respect for human rights.  

# Guidance to 2-24-a-i  

Examples of different levels within an organization include the highest governance body, senior executives, and operational levels.  

The organization can report:  

• the most senior level with oversight of, or accountability for, the implementation of the policy commitments; the functions in the organization with day-to-day responsibility for implementing each of the policy commitments (e.g., human resources with the responsibility for implementing the commitment to respect the rights of workers), including: their reporting lines to senior decision-making levels; the reason for allocating the responsibility to them; whether responsible business conduct is formally discussed at meetings of the highest governance body or senior executives and, if so, which topics are discussed; whether there are other formal or systematic means for discussions about responsible business conduct between different levels or functions in the organization (e.g., a crossfunctional working group).  

# Guidance to 2-24-a-ii  

The organization can describe:  

how it aligns the policy commitments with its:  

broader risk management systems and management policies;   
economic, environmental, social, and human rights impact assessments, and other due diligence processes;   
policies and procedures that set financial and other performance incentives for   
management or workers; how it applies the policy commitments when making decisions, such as about its sourcing and operating locations;   
the systems (e.g., internal audit) it uses to monitor compliance with the policy commitments throughout its activities (across functions and geographic locations) and throughout its business relationships.  

# Guidance to 2-24-a-iii  

The organization can describe:  

its procurement or investment policies and practices, and its engagement with those with   
which it has business relationships, including: whether and how it applies pre-qualification processes, bidding criteria, or screening criteria consistent with the expectations stipulated in the policy commitments for responsible business conduct; whether and how it considers the policy commitments in contracting or investment agreements, or in specific policies or codes of conduct for suppliers;  

whether and how it considers the policy commitments in the process of determining whether to initiate, continue, or terminate a business relationship;  

processes through which it enables or supports business partners and other parties to implement the policy commitments (e.g., capacity building, peer sharing); incentives that it offers to business partners and other parties to implement the policy commitments (e.g., price premiums, increased orders, long-term contracts).  

# Guidance to 2-24-a-iv  

The organization can report:  

the content of the training;   
to whom the training is provided, and whether it is mandatory;   
the form (e.g., in-person, online) and frequency of the training;   
examples of how the organization has determined that the training is effective.  

The organization can report whether the training covers how to implement the policy commitments in general or in specific situations (e.g., ensuring the commitment to privacy when handling customers’ personal data, ensuring the policy commitments are considered in procurement practices).  

The organization can specify if training is provided to those with day-to-day responsibility for and those with oversight of or accountability for implementing the policy commitments. The organization can also specify if training is provided to those with which it has business relationships (e.g., distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). The organization can report the number or percentage of workers, business partners, and other parties that have been trained during the reporting period.  

# Disclosure 2-25 Processes to remediate negative impacts  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. describe its commitments to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of negative impacts that the organization identifies it has caused or contributed to;   
b. describe its approach to identify and address grievances, including the grievance mechanisms that the organization has established or participates in;   
c. describe other processes by which the organization provides for or cooperates in the remediation of negative impacts that it identifies it has caused or contributed to; describe how the stakeholders who are the intended users of the grievance mechanisms are involved in the design, review, operation, and improvement of these mechanisms;   
e. describe how the organization tracks the effectiveness of the grievance mechanisms and other remediation processes, and report examples of their effectiveness, includin stakeholder feedback.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure covers grievance mechanisms that the organization has established or participates in. Grievance mechanisms enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and seek remedy for, the organization’s potential and actual negative impacts on them. This includes impacts on their human rights. This disclosure also covers other processes by which the organization provides for or cooperates in the remediation of negative impacts that it identifies it has caused or contributed to.  

The United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14] and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [12] set out expectations for organizations to provide for or cooperate in the remediation, through legitimate processes, of negative impacts that they identify they have caused or contributed to. The organization is not responsible for the remediation of negative impacts directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships, where the organization has not contributed to the impacts. It can, however, play a role in the remediation. See Box 3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information on causing, contributing, or being directly linked to negative impacts.  

These instruments also set out expectations for organizations to establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms.  

Grievance mechanisms are distinct from whistleblowing mechanisms. Whistleblowing mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about wrongdoing or breaches of the law in the organization’s operations or business relationships, regardless of whether the individuals themselves are harmed or not. Whistleblowing mechanisms are reported under Disclosure 2- 26 in this Standard.  

This disclosure covers the operation of grievance mechanisms and other remediation processes. The actions taken to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of actual negative impacts for material topics are reported under 3-3-d-ii in GRI 3.  

The disclosure is only relevant to environmental remediation processes (e.g., processes to remove contaminants from soil) when these are connected to impacts on stakeholders or grievances raised by stakeholders. However, the remedy provided to stakeholders through the mechanisms and processes covered by this disclosure may involve environmental remediation. The use of environmental remediation processes can be reported under 3-3-d-ii in GRI 3.  

# Guidance to 2-25-b  

Grievance mechanisms refer to any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or nonjudicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy.  

Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include courts (for both criminal and civil actions), labor tribunals, national human rights institutions, National Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices, consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints offices.  

Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the organization, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organizations, civil society organizations, or multi-stakeholder groups.  

Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organization either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organization’s stakeholders. They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organization’s due diligence from those who are directly affected.  

The organization can describe:  

the intended purpose and users of the mechanisms (i.e., whether they are intended for a particular stakeholder category, topic, or region) and whether they enable users to raise human rights-related concerns. For example, the organization can explain that it has established a mechanism for community members to raise complaints about resettlement, as well as a separate hotline for workers to raise concerns about issues affecting their rights, such as health and safety conditions;   
how the mechanisms operate and who administers them (the organization or another party); whether operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered at the organizational level or whether they are administered at a lower level (at the site or project level) and, in such a case, how information from these mechanisms is centralized;   
how the mechanisms have been designed and on which principles and guidelines they are based, including whether they are designed to meet the effectiveness criteria set out in UN Guiding Principle 31 [14];   
the process through which grievances are investigated;   
whether grievances are communicated to the highest governance body;   
whether grievances are treated confidentially;   
whether the mechanisms can be used by stakeholders anonymously through representation by a third party;   
whether the organization requires or provides incentives for the creation or improvement of operational-level grievance mechanisms in workplaces of suppliers;   
whether the organization provides a back-up process for workplaces of suppliers that do not have operational-level grievance mechanisms or where the existing grievance mechanisms in those workplaces result in unresolved issues.  

# Guidance to 2-25-c  

Requirement 2-25-c covers remediation processes other than grievance mechanisms. Such processes lead to the remediation of an impact without mechanisms for filing a formal complaint.  

Examples include instances where the organization takes action to remediate an actual impact evidenced in an impact assessment or a report published by a civil society organization.  

# Guidance to 2-25-d  

The organization can describe, for example, how it engages with stakeholders who are the intended users of the grievance mechanisms, to understand how they want to access the mechanisms to raise concerns, and their expectations about how the mechanisms will operate.  

# Guidance to 2-25-e  

According to UN Guiding Principle 31 [14], effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organization to assess the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.  

The organization can report:  

whether and how the intended users are informed about the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes;   
whether and how the intended users are trained to use the grievance mechanisms and   
remediation processes;   
the accessibility of the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, such as the number of hours per day or days per week they are accessible, and their availability in different languages;   
how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’ human rights and protects them against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising complaints or concerns);   
how satisfied users are with the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, and   
with the resulting outcomes, as well as how the organization assesses user satisfaction;   
the number and types of grievances filed during the reporting period, and the percentage of grievances that were addressed and resolved, including the percentage that were resolved   
through remediation;   
the number of grievances filed during the reporting period that are repeated or recurring;   
changes made to the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes in response to   
lessons learned about their effectiveness.  

Quantitative data, such as the number of grievances, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a low number of grievances could indicate that few incidents have occurred, but it could also signal that their intended users do not trust the mechanisms. For this reason, contextual information should be provided to help information users interpret the data.  

# Disclosure 2-26 Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. describe the mechanisms for individuals to:  

i. seek advice on implementing the organization’s policies and practices for responsible business conduct; ii. raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure covers the organization’s mechanisms for individuals to seek advice and raise concerns about responsible business conduct in the organization's operations and business relationships. Examples of these mechanisms include confidential interviews during site visits, escalation processes (to raise issues through management levels), hotlines, mechanisms to report non-compliance with laws and regulations, and whistleblowing mechanisms.  

These mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about wrongdoing or breaches of the law in the organization’s operations or business relationships, regardless of whether the individuals themselves are harmed or not. They are distinct from grievance mechanisms, which enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and seek remedy / remediation for, the organization’s potential and actual negative impacts on them. Grievance mechanisms are reported under Disclosure 2-25 in this Standard.  

If the organization’s grievance mechanisms and its mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns about responsible business conduct operate in a similar way, the organization can provide a single description of how these mechanisms operate and explain which mechanisms the description covers.  

The organization can report:  

who the intended users of the mechanisms are;   
how the mechanisms operate and which level or function in the organization is assigned responsibility for them;   
whether the mechanisms are operated independently of the organization (e.g., by a third party);   
the process through which concerns are investigated;   
whether requests for advice and concerns raised are treated confidentially;   
whether the mechanisms can be used anonymously.  

Additionally, the organization can report information about the effectiveness of the mechanisms, including:  

whether and how the intended users are informed about the mechanisms and trained on how to use them;   
the accessibility of the mechanisms, such as the number of hours per day or days per week they are available, and their availability in different languages;   
how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’ human rights and protects them against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising concerns);   
how satisfied users are with the mechanisms and with the resulting outcomes;   
the number and types of requests for advice received during the reporting period, and the percentage of requests that were answered;   
the number and types of concerns raised during the reporting period, and the percentage of concerns that were addressed and resolved or found to be unsubstantiated.  

# Disclosure 2-27 Compliance with laws and regulations  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. report the total number of significant instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations during the reporting period, and a breakdown of this total by: i. instances for which fines were incurred; ii. instances for which non-monetary sanctions were incurred;   
b. report the total number and the monetary value of fines for instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that were paid during the reporting period, and a breakdown of this total by: i. fines for instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that occurred in the current reporting period; ii. fines for instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that occurred in previous reporting periods;  

c. describe the significant instances of non-compliance;  

d. describe how it has determined significant instances of non-compliance.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure addresses non-compliance, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations that apply to the organization.  

Non-compliance with laws and regulations can give insight into the ability of management to ensure that the organization conforms to certain performance parameters.  

Laws and regulations can be issued by various bodies, including local, regional, and national governments; regulatory authorities; and public agencies.  

Laws and regulations include:  

international declarations, conventions, and treaties;   
national, subnational, regional, and local regulations;   
binding voluntary agreements made with regulatory authorities and developed as a substitute for implementing a new regulation;   
voluntary agreements (or covenants), if the organization directly joins the agreement, or if public agencies make the agreement applicable to organizations in their territory through legislation or regulation.  

This disclosure includes significant instances of non-compliance that resulted in administrative or judicial sanctions and fines that are being appealed during the reporting period.  

Non-monetary sanctions can include restrictions imposed by governments, regulatory authorities, or public agencies on the organization’s activities or operations, such as withdrawal of trading licenses or licenses to operate in highly regulated industries. They can also include directives to cease or remediate an unlawful activity.  

The organization can use information about fines that have been reported in its audited consolidated financial statements or in the financial information filed on public record, including fines that are being appealed and which may appear as balance sheet reserves in the financial statements.  

If there were no significant instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations or no fines were paid during the reporting period, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the disclosure.  

# Guidance to 2-27-c  

The description of significant instances of non-compliance can include the geographic location where the instance occurred, and the matter to which the instance relates, such as a tax fraud or a spill. The organization is required to report sufficient information for information users to understand the type and the context of significant instances of non-compliance.  

The organization can also explain whether the significant instances are repeated or recurring.  

# Guidance to 2-27-d  

When determining the significant instances of non-compliance, the organization can assess:  

the severity of the impact resulting from the instance;   
external benchmarks used in its sector to determine significant instances of noncompliance.  

# Disclosure 2-28 Membership associations  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

# a. report industry associations, other membership associations, and national or international advocacy organizations in which it participates in a significant role.  

GUIDANCE  

The organization may have a significant role in an association or advocacy organization when it holds a position in the governance body, participates in projects or committees, or provides substantive funding beyond routine membership dues. The role may also be significant when the organization views its membership as strategic to influencing the mission or objective of the association that is critical to the organization’s own activities.  

# 5. Stakeholder engagement  

The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s stakeholder engagement practices, including how it engages in collective bargaining with employees.  

# Disclosure 2-29 Approach to stakeholder engagement  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. describe its approach to engaging with stakeholders, including:  

i. the categories of stakeholders it engages with, and how they are identified;   
ii. the purpose of the stakeholder engagement;   
iii. how the organization seeks to ensure meaningful engagement with stakeholders.  

# GUIDANCE  

Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have interests that are affected or could be affected by the organization’s activities [11]. For more information on stakeholders, see section 2.4 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

This disclosure covers stakeholder engagement undertaken by the organization as part of its ongoing activities, rather than specifically for the purpose of sustainability reporting.  

# Guidance to 2-29-a-i  

Common categories of stakeholders for organizations are business partners, civil society organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other workers, governments, local communities, non-governmental organizations, shareholders and other investors, suppliers, trade unions, and vulnerable groups.  

The organization can explain how it determines which categories of stakeholders to engage with and which categories not to engage with.  

# Guidance to 2-29-a-ii  

The purpose of stakeholder engagement can be, for example, to identify actual and potential impacts or to determine prevention and mitigation responses to potential negative impacts. In some cases, stakeholder engagement is a right in and of itself, such as the right of workers to form or join trade unions or their right to bargain collectively.  

The organization can also report:  

the type of stakeholder engagement (e.g., participation, consultation, information) and its frequency (e.g., ongoing, quarterly, annually);   
when it engages directly with stakeholders and when it engages with credible stakeholder representatives or proxy organizations, or other credible independent expert resources, and why;   
whether stakeholder engagement activities take place at the organizational level or at a lower level, such as at the site or project level, and in the latter case, how information from stakeholder engagement activities is centralized;   
the resources (e.g., financial or human resources) allocated to stakeholder engagement.  

Further information on stakeholder engagement undertaken for specific activities is reported under other disclosures. For example, the organization must report on stakeholder engagement undertaken to determine and manage material topics under 3-1-b and 3-3-f in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# Guidance to 2-29-a-iii  

Meaningful stakeholder engagement is characterized by two-way communication and depends on the good faith of participants on both sides. It is also responsive and ongoing and includes in many cases engaging with relevant stakeholders before decisions are made. [11]  

The organization can report:  

how it takes into account potential barriers to stakeholder engagement (e.g., language and cultural differences, gender and power imbalances, divisions within a community or group);  

how it engages with at-risk or vulnerable groups (e.g., whether it takes specific approaches and gives special attention to potential barriers);   
how it provides stakeholders with information that is understandable and accessible through appropriate communication channels;   
how stakeholder feedback is recorded and integrated into decision-making, and how stakeholders are informed about the way in which their feedback has influenced decisions; how it seeks to respect the human rights of all stakeholders engaged, for example, their rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and protest;   
how it works with business partners to engage with stakeholders in a meaningful way, including the expectations it places on business partners to respect the human rights of stakeholders during engagement.  

# Disclosure 2-30 Collective bargaining agreements  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. report the percentage of total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements;   
b. for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, report whether the organization determines their working conditions and terms of employment based on collective bargaining agreements that cover its other employees or based on collective bargaining agreements from other organizations.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure provides insights into how the organization engages in collective bargaining with its employees. Collective bargaining is a fundamental right at work covered in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention [8].  

Collective bargaining refers to negotiations that take place between one or more employers or employers' organizations and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions). The objective of these negotiations is to reach a collective agreement on working conditions and terms of employment (e.g., wages, working time) and to regulate relations between employers and workers. [3] These negotiations are an important means through which employers’ organizations and workers’ organizations can improve working conditions and labor relations.  

Collective agreements can be made at the level of the organization, at the level of a particular site, at the industry level, and at the national level in countries where this is the practice. Collective agreements can cover specific groups of workers, for example, those performing a specific activity or working at a specific location.  

If the organization has a statement or policy commitment on freedom of association and collective bargaining, this is reported under 2-23-b-i in this Standard or 3-3-c in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

See references [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [21], [25], and [26] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance to 2-30-a  

The organization is required to report the percentage of its employees whose working conditions and terms of employment are regulated by one or more collective bargaining agreements.  

The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements is calculated using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements</td><td>X100</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of employees reported under 2-7-a</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are those employees to whom the organization is obligated to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once.  

This requirement does not ask for the percentage of employees represented by a works council or belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionized employees when the collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union members. Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage of unionized employees. This may be the case when there are no collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not cover all unionized employees.  

The organization can also provide a breakdown of the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements by region, or provide comparisons with industry benchmarks.  

# Guidance to 2-30-b  

There may be instances where collective bargaining agreements cover some or none of the organization’s employees. However, the working conditions and terms of employment of these employees may be influenced or determined by the organization based on other collective bargaining agreements, such as agreements that cover other employees or agreements from other organizations. If this is the case, the organization is required to report it under 2-30-b. If this is not the case, and the working conditions and terms of employment of these employees are not influenced or determined based on other collective bargaining agreements, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with this requirement.

Examples brokers, consultants, contractors, distributors, franchisees, home workers, independent contractors, licensees, manufacturers, primary producers, subcontractors, wholesalers  

A supplier can have a direct business relationship with the organization (often referred to as a first-tier supplier) or an indirect business relationship.  

# supply chain  

range of activities carried out by entities upstream from the organization, which provide products or services that are used in the development of the organization’s own products or services  

# sustainable development / sustainability  

development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  

Source: World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, 1987  

Note:  

The terms ‘sustainability’ and ‘sustainable development’ are used interchangeably in the GRI Standards.  

# temporary employee  

employee with a contract for a limited period (i.e., fixed term contract) that ends when the specific time period expires, or when the specific task or event that has an attached time estimate is completed (e.g., the end of a project or return of replaced employees)  

# under-represented social group  

group of individuals who are less represented within a subset (e.g., a body or committee, employees of an organization) relative to their numbers in the general population, and who therefore have less opportunity to express their economic, social, or political needs and views  

Note 1: Under-represented social groups may include minority groups.  

2: The groups included under this definition depend on the organization’s operating context and are not uniform for every organization.  

# value chain  

# V  

range of activities carried out by the organization, and by entities upstream and downstream from the  organization, to bring the organization’s products or services from their conception to their end use  

Note 1: Entities upstream from the organization (e.g., suppliers) provide products or services that are used in the development of the organization’s own products or services. Entities downstream from the organization (e.g., distributors, customers) receive products or services from the organization.  

Note 2: The value chain includes the supply chain.  

# vulnerable group  

group of individuals with a specific condition or characteristic (e.g., economic, physical, political, social) that could experience negative impacts as a result of the organization’s activities more severely than the general population  

Examples: children and youth; elderly persons; ex-combatants; HIV/AIDS-affected households; human rights defenders; indigenous peoples; internally displaced persons; migrant workers and their families; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; persons who might be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex); persons with disabilities; refugees or returning refugees; women  

Note: Vulnerabilities and impacts can differ by gender.  

# worker  

person that performs work for the organization  

Examples: employees, agency workers, apprentices, contractors, home workers, interns, selfemployed persons, sub-contractors, volunteers, and persons working for organizations other than the reporting organization, such as for suppliers  

Note: In the GRI Standards, in some cases, it is specified whether a particular subset of workers is required to be used.

# Introduction  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides step-by-step guidance for organizations on how to determine material topics. It also explains how the Sector Standards are used in this process. Material topics are topics that represent an organization’s most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights.  

GRI 3 also contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their process of determining material topics, their list of material topics, and how they manage each of their material topics.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 provides step-by-step guidance on how to determine material topics.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard, as well as resources that can be consulted by the organization.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/e7f0b12310f1c61bcda70bd193b4c4907be9191339513cd4a012bc96d42b968f.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to determine its material topics and report all disclosures in this Standard. The organization is required to report Disclosure 3-3 Management of material topics for each material topic.  

Reasons for omission are only permitted for Disclosure 3-3.  

If the organization cannot comply with Disclosure 3-3 or with a requirement in Disclosure 3-3 (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), then the organization is required to specify this in the GRI content index, and provide a reason for omission with an explanation. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout the GRI Standards:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Guidance to determine material topics  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to determine its material topics. When doing this, the organization is also required to use the applicable GRI Sector Standards (see Requirement 3 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 and Box 5 in this Standard).  

This section describes the four steps that the organization should follow in determining its material topics (see Figure 2). Following the steps in this section helps the organization determine its material topics and report the disclosures in section 2 of this Standard. The steps provide guidance and are not requirements on their own.  

![](images/5b40d74e2810433bcdbc3ed57db4dadb7cc24661745f3a5a44d1b3f71515078c.jpg)  
Figure 2. Process to determine material topics  

The first three steps in the process to determine material topics relate to the organization’s ongoing identification and assessment of impacts. During these steps, the organization identifies and assesses its impacts regularly, as part of its day-to-day activities, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders and experts. These ongoing steps allow the organization to actively identify and manage its impacts as they evolve and as new ones arise. The first three steps are conducted independently of the sustainability reporting process, but they inform the last step. In Step 4, the organization prioritizes its most significant impacts for reporting and, in this way, determines its material topics.  

In each reporting period, the organization should review its material topics from the previous reporting period to account for changes in the impacts. Changes in impacts can result from changes in the organization’s activities and business relationships. This review helps ensure the material topics represent the organization’s most significant impacts in each new reporting period.  

The organization should document its process of determining material topics. This includes documenting the approach taken, decisions, assumptions, and subjective judgments made, sources analyzed, and evidence gathered. Accurate records help the organization explain its chosen approach and report the disclosures in section 2 of this Standard. The records facilitate analysis and assurance. See the Verifiability principle in GRI 1 for more information.  

The approach for each step will vary according to the specific circumstances of the organization, such as its business model; sectors; geographic, cultural, and legal operating context; ownership structure; and the nature of its impacts. Given these specific circumstances, the steps should be systematic, documented, replicable, and used consistently in each reporting period. The organization should document any changes in its approach together with the rationale for those changes and their implications.  

The organization’s highest governance body should oversee the process and review and approve the material topics. If the organization does not have a highest governance body, a senior executive or group of senior executives should oversee the process and review and approve the material topics.  

# Box 1. Input to financial and value creation reporting  

The material topics and impacts that have been determined through this process inform financial and value creation reporting. They provide crucial input for identifying financial risks and opportunities related to the organization’s impacts, and for financial valuation. This in turn helps in making financial materiality judgments about what to recognize in financial statements.  

While most, if not all, of the impacts that have been identified through this process will eventually become financially material, sustainability reporting is also highly relevant in its own right as a public interest activity and is independent of the consideration of financial implications. It is therefore important for the organization to report on all the material topics that it has determined using the GRI Standards. These material topics cannot be deprioritized on the basis of not being considered financially material by the organization.  

See Box 1 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on sustainability reporting and financial and value creation reporting.  

The following sections describe the four steps to determine material topics in more detail.  

# Step 1. Understand the organization’s context  

In this step, the organization creates an initial high-level overview of its activities and business relationships, the sustainability context in which these occur, and an overview of its stakeholders. this provides the organization with critical information for identifying its actual and potential impacts.  

The organization should consider the activities, business relationships, stakeholders, and sustainability context of all the entities it controls or has an interest in (e.g., subsidiaries, joint ventures, affiliates), including minority interests.  

Relevant departments and functions within the organization that can assist in this step include communications, human resources, investor relations, legal and compliance departments or functions, marketing and sales, procurement, and product development. The GRI Sector Standards describe the sectors’ context and they can also assist in this step.  

# Activities  

The organization should consider the following in relation to its activities:  

The organization’s purpose, value or mission statements, business model, and strategies.   
The types of activities it carries out (e.g., sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution) and the geographic locations of these activities.   
The types of products and services it offers and the markets it serves (i.e., the types of customers and beneficiaries targeted, and the geographic locations where products and services are offered).   
The sectors in which the organization is active and their characteristics (e.g., whether they involve informal work, whether they are labor or resource intensive).   
The number of employees, including whether they are full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours, permanent or temporary, and their demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, geographic location).   
The number of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization, including the types of worker (e.g., agency workers, contractors, self-employed persons, volunteers), their contractual relationship with the organization (i.e., whether the organization engages these workers directly or indirectly through a third party), and the work they perform.  

# Business relationships  

The organization’s business relationships include relationships with business partners, entities in its value chain (including entities beyond the first tier), and any other entities directly linked to its operations, products, or services. The organization should consider the following in relation to its business relationships:  

The types of business relationships it has (e.g., joint ventures, suppliers, franchisees)  

The types of activities undertaken by those with which it has business relationships (e.g., manufacturing the organization’s products, providing security services to the organization).   
The nature of the business relationships (e.g., whether they are based on a long-term or short-term contract, whether they are based on a specific project or event).   
The geographic locations where the activities of the business relationships take place.  

# Sustainability context  

The organization should consider the following to understand the sustainability context of its activities and business relationships:  

Economic, environmental, human rights, and other societal challenges at local, regional, and global levels related to the organization’s sectors and the geographic location of its activities and business relationships (e.g., climate change, lack of law enforcement, poverty, political conflict, water stress).   
The organization’s responsibility regarding the authoritative intergovernmental instruments with which it is expected to comply.   
Examples include the International Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy [1]; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [3]; the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) Paris Agreement [4]; the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [5]; and the UN International Bill of Human Rights [6].   
The organization’s responsibility regarding the laws and regulations with which it is expected to comply.  

See the Sustainability context principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.  

# Stakeholders  

The organization should identify who its stakeholders are across its activities and business relationships and engage with them to help identify its impacts.  

The organization should draw a full list of individuals and groups whose interests are affected or could be affected by the organization’s activities. Common categories of stakeholders for organizations are business partners, civil society organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other workers, governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, shareholders and other investors, suppliers, trade unions, and vulnerable groups. The organization can further distinguish between individuals and groups whose human rights are affected or could be affected, and individuals and groups with other interests.  

When identifying its stakeholders, the organization should ensure it identifies any individuals or groups it does not have a direct relationship with (e.g., workers in the supply chain or local communities that live at a distance from the organization’s operations) and those who are unable to articulate their views (e.g., future generations) but whose interests are affected or could be affected by the organization’s activities.  

Different lists of stakeholders can be drawn per activity, project, product or service, or other classification that is relevant for the organization.  

See Box 2 in this Standard for information on engaging with stakeholders.  

# Step 2. Identify actual and potential impacts  

In this step, the organization identifies its actual and potential impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, across the organization’s activities and business relationships. Actual impacts are those that have already occurred, and potential impacts are those that could occur but have not yet occurred. These impacts include negative and positive impacts, short-term and long-term impacts, intended and unintended impacts, and reversible and irreversible impacts.  

To identify its impacts, the organization can use information from diverse sources. It can use information from its own or third-party assessments of impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. It can also use information from legal reviews, anti-corruption compliance management systems, financial audits, occupational health and safety inspections, and shareholder filings. It can also use information from any other relevant assessments of business relationships carried out by the organization or by industry or multi-stakeholder initiatives.  

Further information can be gathered through grievance mechanisms that the organization has established itself, or that have been established by other organizations. The organization can also use information from broader enterprise risk management systems, provided that these systems identify the organization’s impacts on the economy, the environment, and people, in addition to identifying risks for the organization itself. It can also use information from external sources, such as news organizations and civil society organizations.  

In addition, the organization should seek to understand the concerns of its stakeholders (see Box 2 in this Standard) and consult internal and external experts, such as civil society organizations or academics.  

# Box 2. Engaging with relevant stakeholders and experts  

The organization should seek to understand the concerns of its stakeholders by consulting them directly in a way that takes into account language and other potential barriers (e.g., cultural differences, gender and power imbalances, divisions within the community). Identifying and removing potential barriers is necessary to ensure that stakeholder engagement is effective.  

Engagement with at-risk or vulnerable groups may necessitate specific approaches and call for special attention. Such approaches include removing social barriers that limit the participation of women in public forums and removing physical barriers that prevent remotely located communities from attending a meeting.  

The organization should respect the human rights of all stakeholders and other individuals with whom it engages (e.g., their rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and protest) and it should protect them against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising complaints or concerns).  

Broad engagement with stakeholders may not be possible in cases that involve many stakeholders or in cases that involve impacts resulting in collective harm. For example, broad engagement may not be possible in the case of corruption, which collectively harms the population of the jurisdiction in which it takes place or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to collective transboundary harm.  

In such cases, the organization may engage with credible stakeholder representatives or proxy organizations (e.g., non-governmental organizations, trade unions). This is also relevant in cases where engaging with individuals could undermine certain rights or collective interests. For example, when considering a decision to restructure or shut down a factory, it may be important for an organization to engage with trade unions to mitigate the employment impacts of the decision. In such a case, engaging with individual workers could undermine the right of workers to form or join trade unions and to bargain collectively.  

The degree of impact on stakeholders may inform the degree of engagement. The organization should prioritize the most severely affected or potentially affected stakeholders for engagement.  

Where direct consultation is not possible, the organization should consider reasonable alternatives, such as consulting credible independent experts, such as national human rights institutions, human rights and environmental defenders, trade unions, and other members of civil society.  

See references [2] and [5] in the Bibliography.  

In this step, the organization needs to consider the impacts described in the applicable GRI Sector Standards and determine whether these impacts apply to it.  

Impacts may change over time as the organization’s activities, business relationships, and context evolve. New activities, new business relationships, and major changes in operations or the operating context (e.g., new market entry, product launch, policy change, wider changes to the organization) could lead to changes in the organization’s impacts. For this reason, the organization should assess its context and identify its impacts on an ongoing basis.  

In cases where the organization has limited resources available for identifying its impacts, it should first identify its negative impacts, before identifying positive impacts, to ensure it complies with applicable laws, regulations, and authoritative intergovernmental instruments.  

# Identifying negative impacts  

Identifying actual and potential negative impacts with which the organization is involved or could be involved is the first step of due diligence. The organization should consider actual and potential impacts that it causes or contributes to through its activities, as well as actual and potential impacts that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships (see Box 3 in this Standard).  

In some cases, the organization might be unable to identify actual and potential negative impacts across all its activities and business relationships. This could be, for example, because the organization has diverse or multiple global operations or because its value chain comprises many entities. In such cases, the organization may carry out an initial assessment or scoping exercise to identify general areas across its activities and business relationships (e.g., product lines, suppliers located in specific geographic locations) where negative impacts are most likely to be present and significant. Once the organization has conducted the initial assessment or scoping exercise, it can identify and assess actual and potential negative impacts for these general areas.  

As part of the initial assessment or scoping exercise, the organization should consider impacts commonly associated with its sectors, its products, geographic locations, or with specific organizations (i.e., impacts associated with a specific entity of the organization, or with an entity it has a business relationship with, such as a poor history of conduct in relation to respecting human rights). It should also consider impacts it has been involved with or knows it is likely to be involved with. In addition to the GRI Sector Standards, the organization can use the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [2] and the OECD sectoral guidance on due diligence [13] for information on impacts commonly associated with sectors, products, geographic locations, and specific organizations. It can also use reports from governments, environmental agencies, international organizations, civil society organizations, workers’ representatives and trade unions, national human rights institutions, media, or other experts.  

See references [2], [3], [5] and [13] in the Bibliography.  

# Box 3. Causing, contributing, or being directly linked to negative impacts  

An organization ‘causes’ a negative impact if its activities on their own result in the impact, for example, if the organization pays a bribe to a foreign public official, or if it withdraws water from a water-stressed aquifer without replenishing the water level.  

An organization ‘contributes to’ a negative impact if its activities lead, facilitate, or incentivize another entity to cause the impact. The organization can also contribute to a negative impact if its activities in combination with the activities of other entities cause the impact. For example, if the organization sets a short lead time for a supplier to deliver a product, despite knowing from experience that this production time is not feasible, this could result in excessive overtime for the supplier’s workers. In such a case, the organization may contribute to negative impacts on the health and safety of these workers.  

An organization can cause or contribute to a negative impact through its actions as well as by failure to take action (e.g., failure to prevent or mitigate a potential negative impact).  

Even if an organization does not cause or contribute to a negative impact, its operations, products, or services may be ‘directly linked to’ a negative impact by its business relationships. For example, if the organization uses cobalt in its products that is mined using child labor, the negative impact (i.e., child labor) is directly linked to the organization’s products through the tiers of business relationships in its supply chain (i.e., through the smelter and minerals trader, to the mining enterprise that uses child labor), even though the organization has not caused or contributed to the negative impact itself. ‘Direct linkage’ is not defined by the link between the organization and the other entity, and is therefore not limited to direct contractual relationships, such as ‘direct sourcing’.  

The way the organization is involved with negative impacts determines how it should address the impacts and whether it has a responsibility to provide for or cooperate in their remediation (see section 2.3 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021).  

See references [2] and [5] in the Bibliography. For additional guidance and examples, see the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [2], pages 70-72, and the United Nations’ (UN) The Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights: An Interpretive Guide [15], pages 15-18.  

# Identifying positive impacts  

To identify its actual and potential positive impacts, the organization should assess the manner in which it contributes or could contribute to sustainable development through its activities, for example, through its products, services, investments, procurement practices, employment practices, or tax payments. This also includes assessing how the organization can shape its purpose, business model, and strategies to deliver positive impacts that contribute to the goal of sustainable development.  

An example of a positive impact is an organization adopting measures that lower the cost of renewable energy for customers, thereby allowing more customers to switch from using non-renewable energy to renewable energy, and thus contributing to mitigating climate change. Another example is an organization choosing an area with high unemployment to open a new facility so that it can hire and train unemployed members of the local community, and in this way, contribute to job creation and community development.  

The organization should consider any negative impacts that could result from activities that aim for a positive contribution to sustainable development. Negative impacts cannot be offset by positive impacts. For example, a renewable energy installation may reduce a region’s dependence on fossil fuels and bring energy to underserved communities. However, if it displaces local indigenous communities from their lands or territories without their consent, this negative impact should be addressed and remediated, and it cannot be compensated by the positive impacts.  

# Step 3. Assess the significance of the impacts  

The organization may identify many actual and potential impacts. In this step, the organization assesses the significance of its identified impacts to prioritize them. Prioritization enables the organization to take action to address the impacts and also to determine its material topics for reporting. Prioritizing impacts for action is relevant where it is not feasible to address all impacts at once.  

Assessing the significance of the impacts involves quantitative and qualitative analysis. How significant an impact is will be specific to the organization and will be influenced by the sectors in which it operates, and its business relationships, among other factors. In some instances, this may need a subjective decision. The organization should consult with relevant stakeholders (see Box 2 in this Standard) and business relationships to assess the significance of its impacts. The organization should also consult relevant internal or external experts.  

# Assessing the significance of negative impacts  

The significance of an actual negative impact is determined by the severity of the impact. The significance of a potential negative impact is determined by the severity and likelihood of the impact.  

The combination of the severity and the likelihood of a negative impact can be referred to as ‘risk’. The assessment of the significance of the impacts can be included within broader enterprise risk management systems, provided that these systems assess the impacts the organization has on the economy, the environment, and people, in addition to assessing risks for the organization itself.  

# Severity  

The severity of an actual or potential negative impact is determined by the following characteristics:  

• Scale: how grave the impact is.   
• Scope: how widespread the impact is, for example, the number of individuals affected or the extent of environmental damage.   
• Irremediable character: how hard it is to counteract or make good the resulting harm.  

The scale of a negative impact (i.e., how grave the impact is) can depend on whether the impact leads to noncompliance with laws and regulations or with authoritative intergovernmental instruments with which the organization is expected to comply. For example, if a negative impact leads to a violation of human rights or fundamental rights at work or to non-compliance with the reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be achieved under the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) Paris Agreement [4], the scale of this impact can be considered greater.  

The scale of a negative impact can also depend on the context in which the impact takes place. For example, the scale of the impact of an organization’s water withdrawal can depend on the area from which water is withdrawn. The scale will be greater if water is withdrawn from an area affected by water stress, compared to an area with abundant water resources to meet the demands of water users and ecosystems.  

Any of the three characteristics (scale, scope, and irremediable character) can make an impact severe. But it is often the case that these characteristics are interdependent: the greater the scale or the scope of an impact, the less remediable it is.  

The severity – and therefore the significance – of an impact are not absolute concepts. The severity of an impact should be assessed in relation to the other impacts of the organization. For example, an organization should compare the severity of the impacts of its GHG emissions against the severity of its other impacts. The organization should not assess the significance of its GHG emissions in relation to global GHG emissions, as that comparison could lead to the misleading conclusion that the organization’s emissions are not significant.  

See references [2], [3], [4] and [5] in the Bibliography.  

# Likelihood  

The likelihood of a potential negative impact refers to the chance of the impact happening. The likelihood of an impact can be measured or determined qualitatively or quantitatively. It can be described using general terms (e.g., very likely, likely) or mathematically using probability (e.g., 10 in 100, $10\%$ ) or frequency over a given time period (e.g., once every three years).1  

# Human rights  

In the case of potential negative human rights impacts, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood. For example, an organization operating a nuclear power facility may prioritize the potential impact related to loss of life in cases of natural disasters affecting the power facility, even though natural disasters are less likely to occur than other incidents.  

The severity of a negative human rights impact is not limited to physical harm. Highly severe impacts can occur in relation to any human right. For example, interfering with, damaging, or destroying a sacred space without consultation or agreement with the people for whom the space has spiritual importance can have a highly severe impact on their cultural rights.  

When prioritizing other types of impacts, such as potential negative environmental impacts, the organization may also choose to prioritize highly severe negative impacts even though they may be less likely to occur.  

# Assessing the significance of positive impacts  

The significance of an actual positive impact is determined by the scale and scope of the impact. The significance of a potential positive impact is determined by the scale and scope as well as the likelihood of the impact.  

# Scale and scope  

In the case of positive impacts, the scale of an impact refers to how beneficial the impact is or could be, and the scope refers to how widespread the impact is or could be (e.g., the number of individuals or the extent of environmental resources that are or could be positively affected).  

# Likelihood  

The likelihood of a potential positive impact refers to the chance of the impact happening. The likelihood of an impact can be measured or determined qualitatively or quantitatively. It can be described using general terms (e.g., very likely, likely) or mathematically using probability (e.g., 10 in 100, $10\%$ ) or frequency over a given time period (e.g., once every three years).2  

# Step 4. Prioritize the most significant impacts for reporting  

In this step, to determine its material topics for reporting, the organization prioritizes its impacts based on their significance.  

# Setting a threshold to determine which topics are material  

The significance of an impact is assessed in relation to the other impacts the organization has identified. The organization should arrange its impacts from most to least significant and define a cut-off point or threshold to determine which of the impacts it will focus its reporting on. The organization should document this threshold. To facilitate prioritization, the organization should group the impacts into topics (see Box 4 in this Standard).  

For example, when setting a threshold, the organization first groups its impacts into a number of topics and ranks them, based on their significance, from highest to lowest priority. The organization then needs to determine how many of the topics it will report on, starting with those that have the highest priority. Where to set the threshold is up to the organization. For transparency, the organization can provide a visual representation of the prioritization that shows the initial list of topics it has identified and the threshold it has set for reporting.  

The significance of an impact is the sole criterion to determine whether a topic is material for reporting. The organization cannot use difficulty in reporting on a topic or the fact that it does not yet manage the topic as criteria to determine whether or not to report on the topic. In cases where the organization does not manage a material topic, it can report the reasons for not doing so or any plans to manage the topic to comply with the requirements in Disclosure 3-3 Management of material topics in this Standard.  

While some topics can cover both negative and positive impacts, it may not always be possible to compare the two. Additionally, negative impacts cannot be offset by positive impacts. The organization should therefore prioritize negative impacts separately from positive impacts.  

Even if the organization has not prioritized an actual or potential negative impact for reporting, it may still be responsible for addressing the impact in line with applicable laws, regulations, or authoritative intergovernmental instruments. See section 2.3 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.  

# Box 4. Grouping impacts into topics  

Grouping impacts into topics, like ‘water and effluents’, helps the organization report in a cohesive way about multiple impacts related to the same topic.  

The organization can group impacts into topics according to general categories that relate to a business activity, stakeholder category, type of business relationship, or an economic or environmental resource. For example, an organization’s activities result in water pollution, which causes negative impacts on both ecosystems and local communities’ access to safe drinking water. The organization can group these impacts into the topic of ‘water and effluents’ as both impacts relate to its use of water.  

The organization can refer to the topics in the GRI Topic Standards and the GRI Sector Standards. These topics provide a useful reference for understanding the range of impacts that can be covered in each topic. For impacts or topics that the GRI Standards do not cover, the organization can refer to other sources, such as authoritative intergovernmental instruments or industry standards.  

# Testing the material topics  

The organization should test its selection of material topics against the topics in the applicable GRI Sector Standards.   
This helps the organization ensure that it has not overlooked any topics that are likely to be material for its sectors.  

The organization should also test its selection of material topics with potential information users and experts who understand the organization or its sectors and have insight into one or more of the material topics. This can help the organization validate the threshold it has set to determine which topics are material to report. Examples of experts the organization can consult are academics, consultants, investors, lawyers, national institutions, and non-governmental organizations.  

The organization should seek external assurance to assess the quality and credibility of its process of determining material topics. See section 5.2 in GRI 1 for more information on seeking external assurance.  

This testing process results in a list of the organization’s material topics.  

# Approval of the material topics  

The organization’s highest governance body should review and approve the list of material topics. If such a body does not exist, the list should be approved by a senior executive or group of senior executives in the organization.  

# Determining what to report for each material topic  

Once the organization has determined its material topics, it needs to determine what to report for each material topic.   
See Requirement 4 and Requirement 5 in GRI 1 for information about how to report on material topics.  

# Box 5. Using GRI Sector Standards to determine material topics  

The GRI Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The topics have been identified on the basis of the sectors’ most significant impacts, using multi-stakeholder expertise, authoritative intergovernmental instruments, and other relevant evidence.  

The organization is required to use the applicable Sector Standards when determining its material topics (see Requirement 3-b in GRI 1: Foundation 2021). Using the Sector Standards is not a substitute for the process of determining material topics, but an aid. The organization still needs to consider its own specific circumstances when determining its material topics.  

The organization is required to review each topic described in the applicable Sector Standards and determine whether it is a material topic for the organization.  

There can be cases where a topic included in the applicable Sector Standards is not material for the organization. This may be because the organization assesses the specific impacts the topic covers to be absent. It may also be because, compared to other impacts of the organization, the ones that the topic covers are not among the most significant.  

For example, an organization in the oil and gas sector is required to use GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021 when determining its material topics. One of the topics included in this Sector Standard is land and resource rights. Oil and gas projects often require land for operations, access routes, and distribution. This can lead to impacts such as involuntary resettlement of local communities, which can involve their physical displacement and economic displacement through lost access to resources. However, if the organization’s oil and gas projects do not result in these impacts and will not result in these impacts in the future, the organization may determine that the topic of land and resource rights is not a material topic for the organization. In such a case, the reporting organization is required to explain why it has determined that this topic, which is likely to be material for organizations in the oil and gas sector, is not a material topic for the organization.  

If any of the topics that are included in the applicable Sector Standards have been determined by the organization as not material, the organization is required to list them in the GRI content index and explain why they are not material (see Requirement 3-b-ii in GRI 1). This explanation helps information users understand why the organization has determined that topics that are likely to be material for the organization’s sectors are not material in its specific circumstances.  

A brief explanation in the GRI content index of why the topic is not material is sufficient to comply with Requirement 3-b-ii in GRI 1. In the previous example, the organization could explain that land and resource rights is not a material topic because its existing oil and gas projects are located in uninhabited areas, and there are no plans to start projects in new areas.  

# 2. Disclosures on material topics  

The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s material topics, how the organization has determined these topics, and how it manages each material topic. Material topics are topics that represent the organization’s most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. Section 1 of this Standard provides guidance on how to determine material topics and helps in understanding and reporting the disclosures in this section.  

# Disclosure 3-1 Process to determine material topics  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# The organization shall:  

a. describe the process it has followed to determine its material topics, including:  

i. how it has identified actual and potential, negative and positive impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, across its activities and business relationships;   
ii. how it has prioritized the impacts for reporting based on their significance;  

b. specify the stakeholders and experts whose views have informed the process of determining its material topics.  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure requires information on how the organization has determined its material topics. The list of material topics is reported under Disclosure 3-2 in this Standard.  

The organization is required to use the applicable GRI Sector Standards when determining its material topics. If any of the topics that are included in the applicable Sector Standards have been determined by the organization as not material, the organization is required to list them in the GRI content index and explain why they are not material. See Requirement 5 and Requirement 7 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 and Box 5 in this Standard for more information.  

In the absence of applicable Sector Standards, the organization should explain how it has considered impacts commonly associated with its sectors, and whether any of these impacts have been determined as not material, together with an explanation for why this is the case. The organization should also explain how it has considered impacts commonly associated with its products and geographic locations. See section 1 in this Standard and the Sector Standards for guidance on impacts commonly associated with sectors, products, and geographic locations.  

# Guidance to 3-1-a-i  

The organization should describe the methods used to identify its impacts, for example, economic, environmental, social, and human rights impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, or using information from external sources, such as civil society organizations. The organization should describe the sources and the evidence it has used to identify the impacts.  

The organization should also describe the scope it has defined when identifying the impacts, for example, whether it has identified short-term as well as long-term impacts. The organization should also describe any limitations or exclusions, for example, whether it has excluded business relationships from certain parts of its value chain when identifying the impacts.  

Disclosure 2-12 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires information on the role of the highest governance body in overseeing the organization’s due diligence and other processes to identify its impacts on the economy, environment, and people.  

# Guidance to 3-1-a-ii  

The organization should describe how it has assessed the significance of the impacts, including any assumptions and subjective judgments it has made.  

The significance of an actual negative impact is determined by the severity of the impact (scale, scope, and irremediable character), while the significance of a potential negative impact is determined by the severity and likelihood of the impact. In the case of potential negative human rights impacts, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.  

The significance of an actual positive impact is determined by the scale and scope of the impact, while the significance of a potential positive impact is determined by its scale and scope as well as its likelihood.  

See section 1 in this Standard for more guidance on assessing the significance of impacts.  

The organization should explain if it has used a different approach to prioritize its impacts, for example, if it has prioritized potential negative environmental impacts based on severity only.  

The organization should also describe how it has defined the threshold to determine which topics are material for reporting, and whether it has tested its selection of material topics with potential information users and experts. The organization is required to report whether the highest governance body is responsible for reviewing and approving the reported information, including the organization’s material topics, under Disclosure 2-14 in GRI 2. The organization should explain any changes to its initial selection of material topics following internal approval and testing with potential information users and experts.  

For transparency, the organization can provide a visual representation of the prioritization that shows the initial list of topics it has identified and the threshold it has set for reporting.  

# Guidance to 3-1-b  

Requirement 3-1-b enables the organization to explain how engagement with stakeholders and experts informs the ongoing identification and assessment of its impacts.  

The organization can report whether and how it has prioritized stakeholders for engagement and the methods used to engage with them. It can also report any conflicting interests that have arisen among different stakeholders and how the organization has resolved these conflicting interests.  

# Disclosure 3-2 List of material topics  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The organization shall:  

a. list its material topics;  

# GUIDANCE  

b. report changes to the list of material topics compared to the previous reporting period.  

This disclosure requires information on the organization’s material topics. The process of determining material topics is reported under Disclosure 3-1 in this Standard.  

The organization is required to include the material topics listed under this disclosure in the GRI content index. If the organization has determined any of the topics included in the applicable Sector Standards as not material, then the organization is required to list them in the content index and explain why they are not material. See Requirement 5 and Requirement 7 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.  

# Guidance to 3-2-a  

The organization can group material topics by relevant categories if this helps communicate its impacts. For example, the organization can indicate which of its material topics represent its negative human rights impacts.  

# Guidance to 3-2-b  

Requirement 3-2-b enables the organization to explain why a topic that it determined as material in the previous reporting period is no longer considered to be material or why a new topic has been determined as material for the current reporting period.  

# Disclosure 3-3 Management of material topics  

# REQUIREMENTS  

For each material topic reported under Disclosure 3-2, the organization shall:  

a. describe the actual and potential, negative and positive impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights;   
b. report whether the organization is involved with the negative impacts through its activities or as a result of its business relationships, and describe the activities or business relationships;   
c. describe its policies or commitments regarding the material topic;   
d. describe actions taken to manage the topic and related impacts, including: i. actions to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts; ii. actions to address actual negative impacts, including actions to provide for or cooperate in their remediation; iii. actions to manage actual and potential positive impacts;  

e. report the following information about tracking the effectiveness of the actions taken:  

i. processes used to track the effectiveness of the actions;   
ii. goals, targets, and indicators used to evaluate progress;   
iii. the effectiveness of the actions, including progress toward the goals and targets;   
iv. lessons learned and how these have been incorporated into the organization’s operational policies and procedures;  

f. describe how engagement with stakeholders has informed the actions taken (3-3-d) and how it has informed whether the actions have been effective (3-3-e).  

# GUIDANCE  

This disclosure requires the organization to explain how it manages each of its material topics. This means that the organization is required to report this disclosure for each of its material topics. The requirements in this disclosure apply to every material topic.  

In addition to this disclosure, there may also be disclosures and guidance in the Topic Standards and Sector Standards that address reporting information about how the organization manages a topic. For example, some Topic Standards contain disclosures about specific actions or methods to manage a topic. The organization does not need to repeat this information under Disclosure 3-3 if it is already reported under another disclosure. The organization can report the information once and provide a reference to this information to fulfill the corresponding requirements in Disclosure 3-3.  

If the organization’s approach to managing a material topic, such as its policies or actions taken, applies to other material topics, the organization does not need to repeat this information for each topic. The organization can report this information once, with a clear explanation of all the topics it covers.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in this disclosure because the item (e.g., policy, action) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization does not manage a material topic, it can comply with the requirements under this disclosure by explaining the reasons for not managing the topic or describing any plans to manage it.  

# Guidance to 3-3-a  

Requirement 3-3-a enables the organization to indicate if a topic is material because of negative impacts, positive impacts, or both. It does not require a list of all the impacts identified or a detailed description of the impacts. Instead, the organization can provide a high-level overview of the impacts it has identified.  

# Describing negative impacts  

The organization can describe:  

whether the negative impacts are actual or potential;   
the time frame of the negative impacts (i.e., whether the negative effects are short-term or long-term and when they are likely to arise);   
whether the negative impacts are systemic (e.g., child labor or forced labor in countries where the organization operates or sources materials from) or are related to individual incidents (e.g., an oil spill); the economic resources, environmental resources, and stakeholders (without identifying specific individuals) that are negatively affected or could be negatively affected, including their geographic location.  

Reporting information about negative impacts can help the organization demonstrate that it recognizes these impacts and has taken action or intends to address them. The organization may have concerns about reporting information about negative impacts even if these impacts are publicly known. In cases where negative impacts are publicly known, failure to acknowledge these impacts and to explain how they are being addressed could have consequences for the organization financially, operationally, or reputationally. If the organization is unable to disclose specific information (e.g., because of stakeholders’ right to privacy), it can provide the information in aggregated or anonymized form, or it can make a reference to the impacts commonly associated with its sectors, its products, or geographic locations. [11]  

# Describing positive impacts  

The organization can describe:  

whether the positive impacts are actual or potential;   
the time frame of the positive impacts (i.e., whether the positive effects are short-term or long-term and when they are likely to arise);   
the activities that result in the positive impacts (e.g., products, services, investments, procurement practices);   
the economic resources, environmental resources, and stakeholders (without identifying specific individuals) that are positively affected or could be positively affected, including their geographic location.  

# Guidance to 3-3-b  

The way the organization is involved with negative impacts determines how it should address the impacts and whether it has a responsibility to provide for or cooperate in their remediation (see section 2.3 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021). Requirement 3-3-b provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the actions taken by the organization to manage its negative impacts. The actions taken are reported under 3-3-d-i and 3-3-d-ii.  

Under requirement 3-3-b, the organization is required to report whether it is involved with the negative impacts through its activities or as a result of its business relationships. Where possible, the organization should also report:  

whether it is or could be causing or contributing to the negative impacts through its activities; or   
whether the impacts are or could be directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships even if it has not contributed to them.  

See Box 3 in this Standard for more information on causing, contributing, or being directly linked to negative impacts.  

Under requirement 3-3-b, the organization is also required to describe the activities or business relationships. This enables the organization to indicate if the impacts related to a material topic are widespread in the organization’s activities or business relationships, or if the impacts concern specific activities or business relationships.  

If the impacts concern specific activities, the organization should describe the types of activities (e.g., manufacturing, retail) and their geographic location. If the impacts concern specific business relationships, the organization should describe the types of business relationships (e.g., suppliers of raw materials, franchisees), their position in the value chain, and their geographic location.  

For example, if the organization has identified that its activities at specific sites could cause water pollution, it should describe the types of activities carried out at these sites and the geographic location of these sites. Or, if the organization has identified that it is directly linked to child labor by the business relationships in its supply chain, it should specify the types of suppliers using child labor (e.g., sub-contractors doing embroidery work for the organization’s products) and the geographic location of these suppliers.  

The organization can provide additional contextual information for understanding the extent of its impacts. Adding to the previous examples, the organization can report how many of its sites could cause water pollution (e.g., $60\%$ of sites, five out of 12 sites) or the proportion of production these sites represent, or it can report the estimated number of sub-contractors using child labor that do embroidery work for the organization.  

# Guidance to 3-3-c  

Requirement 3-3-c entails describing the policies or commitments the organization has developed specifically for the topic, in addition to the policy commitments reported under Disclosure 2-23 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the organization has described its policies for a material topic under Disclosure 2-23, it can provide a reference to this information under 3-3-c and does not need to repeat the information. See Disclosure 2-23 in GRI 2 for guidance on how to report information about policies.  

When reporting its commitments regarding the material topic, the organization should provide a statement of intent to manage the topic or explain:  

• the organization’s stance on the topic; whether the commitment to manage the topic is based on regulatory compliance or extends beyond it;   
• compliance with authoritative intergovernmental instruments related to the topic.  

# Guidance to 3-3-d  

Requirement 3-3-d enables the organization to explain how it responds to its impacts. It does not require a detailed description of actions taken in relation to each impact. Instead, the organization can provide a high-level overview of how it manages its impacts.  

The organization should report how it integrates the findings from its identification and assessment of impacts across relevant internal functions and processes, including:  

the level and function within the organization that has been assigned responsibility for managing the impacts;   
the internal decision-making, budget allocation, and oversight processes (e.g., internal audit) to enable effective actions to manage the impacts.  

Disclosure 2-12 and Disclosure 2-13 in GRI 2 require information on the role of the highest governance body in overseeing the management of the organization’s impacts and on how it delegates responsibility for this.  

The organization should also report how it manages actual impacts identified in previous reporting periods and which it continues to manage during the current reporting period.  

# Guidance to 3-3-d-i  

The organization should report:  

examples of actions taken to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts (e.g.,   
adaptation/modification measures, facility upgrading, training, red-flag systems);   
approaches taken to prevent or mitigate systemic negative impacts;   
how the organization applies the precautionary principle, including:   
- how the organization proactively informs the public about potential negative impacts of its activities, products, and services, and how it deals with related questions and complaints; the organization’s support or contribution to scientific research related to evaluating potential negative impacts of its activities, products, and services; the organization’s participation in collaborative efforts to share knowledge and to prevent negative impacts of its activities, products, and services;  

• how the organization uses or increases its leverage to motivate its business relationships to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts. For example, whether the organization uses or increases its leverage by enforcing contractual requirements, implements incentives such as future orders, provides training and support, or actively collaborates with other actors to motivate its business relationships to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts; whether the organization has terminated a business relationship because it lacks the leverage to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts and, if so, whether it has assessed if terminating the relationship could itself result in negative impacts.  

See Guidance to 2-23-a-iii in GRI 2 for more information on ‘precautionary principle’.  

# Guidance to 3-3-d-ii  

The organization should report:  

examples of actions taken to remediate actual negative impacts, including examples of specific remedies or types of remedy provided; how grievance mechanisms or other remediation processes (reported under Disclosure 2- 25 in GRI 2) have made it possible for actual negative impacts to be remediated.  

See Disclosure 2-25 in GRI 2 for more information on processes to remediate negative impacts.  

# Guidance to 3-3-e  

Requirement 3-3-e enables the organization to report information about the effectiveness of its actions to manage its impacts. Tracking the effectiveness of its actions is necessary for an organization to learn if its policies and processes are being implemented optimally. It is also necessary for knowing if it has responded effectively to its impacts and to drive continuous improvement.  

The organization should also report information about the effectiveness of its actions to manage actual impacts from previous reporting periods. This applies in cases where the organization has assessed the effectiveness of these actions or derived lessons during the current reporting period.  

# Guidance to 3-3-e-i  

Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.  

# Guidance to 3-3-e-ii  

When reporting on goals and targets, the organization should report:  

how the goals and targets are set;   
whether and how the goals and targets take into account the sustainability context in which the impacts take place (e.g., sustainable development goals and conditions, the limits and demands placed on environmental resources). See the Sustainability context principle in GRI 1 for more information;   
whether the goals and targets are informed by expectations in authoritative intergovernmental instruments and, where relevant, by scientific consensus;   
whether goals and targets are mandatory (based on legislation) or voluntary. If they are   
mandatory, the organization can list the relevant legislation;   
the organization’s activities or business relationships to which the goals and targets apply;   
the baseline for the goals and targets;   
the timeline for achieving the goals and targets.  

Targets can be qualitative (e.g., implementing a management system by a certain date) or quantitative (e.g., reducing greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions by a certain percentage by a certain date).  

The indicators used to evaluate progress can also be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative indicators can bring precision and enable comparisons. Qualitative information is often needed to put quantitative information into context, enable its interpretation, and determine which comparisons and conclusions are likely to be most valid. The Topic Standards and Sector Standards include qualitative and quantitative indicators.  

# Guidance to 3-3-e-iii  

Requirement 3-3-e-iii enables the organization to show the extent to which the actions taken have been effective. Information on the effectiveness of the actions can be obtained, for example, from the outcomes of internal or external auditing or verification, data collected through measurement systems, and stakeholder feedback. The organization should show that there is a credible link between the specific action taken by the organization and the effective management of impacts.  

For example, to show the effectiveness of its actions to support its suppliers with improving their working conditions, the organization can report survey feedback from the suppliers’ workers showing that working conditions have improved. Additional information the organization can provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified through independent audits.  

Similarly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of its actions to improve the quality of its water discharge, the organization can report data showing a decrease in the concentration of total dissolved solids $({\sf m g/L})$ in the water discharge.  

When reporting progress toward its goals and targets, the organization should report whether progress is satisfactory or not. If a goal or target has not been achieved, the organization should explain why.  

# Guidance to 3-3-e-iv  

Managing impacts is typically an ongoing process requiring continuous improvement based on learning from practice.  

The organization is not required to provide a detailed description of lessons learned in relation to each material topic. Instead, the organization can provide examples to show how it incorporates lessons learned to manage impacts more successfully in the future.  

For example, the organization can briefly describe lessons learned that have led to changes in its policies or practices (e.g., training for workers, giving additional attention to the performance of suppliers), or that have led to plans for changes that will manage impacts more successfully in the future.  

Lessons learned may be derived from the organization’s own processes (e.g., root cause analysis), from its business relationships, or from stakeholder or expert feedback.  

# Guidance to 3-3-f  

The organization can explain, for example, whether and how affected stakeholders have been involved in determining an appropriate remedy for a negative impact or how stakeholder feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken.

# Introduction  

GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021 provides information for organizations in the oil and gas sector about their likely material topics. These topics are likely to be material for organizations in the oil and gas sector on the basis of the sector’s most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including on their human rights.  

GRI 11 also contains a list of disclosures for organizations in the oil and gas sector to report in relation to each likely material topic. This includes disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards and other sources.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 provides a high-level overview of the oil and gas sector, including its activities, business relationships, context, and the connections between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the likely material topics for the sector.   
Section 2 outlines the topics that are likely to be material for organizations in the oil and gas sector and therefore potentially merit reporting. For each likely material topic, the sector’s most significant impacts are described and disclosures to report information about the organization’s impacts in relation to the topic are listed.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography contains authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard, listed by topic. It also lists further resources that can be consulted by the organization.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides an overview of the sector this Standard applies to, an overview of the system of GRI Standards, and further information on using this Standard.  

# Sector this Standard applies to  

GRI 11 applies to organizations undertaking any of the following:  

Exploration and production of onshore and offshore oil and gas. Supply of equipment and services to oil fields and offshore platforms, such as drilling, exploration, seismic information services and platform construction. Transportation and storage of oil and gas, such as oil and gas pipeline operators. • Refining of oil into petroleum products for use as fuels and as feedstocks for chemicals.  

This Standard can be used by any organization in the oil and gas sector, regardless of size, type, geographic location, or reporting experience.  

The organization must use all applicable Sector Standards for the sectors in which it has substantial activities.  

# Sector classifications  

Table 1 lists industry groupings relevant to the oil and gas sector covered in this Standard in the Global Industry Classification Standard $(\mathsf{G I C S}\mathbb{\otimes})$ [4], the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) [3], the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) [6], and the Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS®) [5].  The table is intended to assist an organization in identifying whether GRI 11 applies to it and is for reference only.

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/fda3f6fbbe0d4fc53d17d2e8f7af8afed2a3fd802dfa14a4b1aac28ff69e13a8.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

An organization in the oil and gas sector reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to use this Standard when determining its material topics and then when determining what information to report for the material topics.  

# Determining material topics  

Material topics represent an organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including their human rights.  

Section 1 of this Standard provides contextual information that can help the organization in identifying and assessing its impacts.  

Section 2 outlines the topics that are likely to be material for organizations in the oil and gas sector. The organization is required to review each topic described and determine whether it is a material topic for it.  

The organization needs to use this Standard when determining its material topics. However, circumstances for each organization vary, and the organization needs to determine its material topics according to its specific circumstances, such as its business model; geographic, cultural, and legal operating context; ownership structure; and the nature of its impacts. Because of this, not all topics listed in this Standard may be material for all organizations in the oil and gas sector. See GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for step-by-step guidance on how to determine material topics.  

If the organization has determined any of the topics included in this Standard as not material, then the organization is required to list them in the GRI content index and explain why they are not material.  

See Requirement 3 in GRI 1 Foundation 2021 and Box 5 in GRI 3 or more information on using Sector Standards to determine material topics.  

# Determining what to report  

For each material topic, an organization reports information about its impacts and how it manages these impacts.  

Once an organization has determined a topic included in this Standard to be material, the Standard also helps the organization identify disclosures to report information about its impacts relating to that topic.  

For each topic in section 2 of this Standard, a reporting sub-section is included. These sub-sections list disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards that are relevant to the topic. They may also list additional sector disclosures and recommendations for the organization to report. This is done in cases where the Topic Standards do not provide disclosures, or where the disclosures from the Topic Standards do not provide sufficient information about the organization’s impacts in relation to a topic. These additional sector disclosures and recommendations may be based on other sources. Figure 2 illustrates how the reporting included in each topic is structured.  

The organization is required to report the disclosures from the Topic Standards listed for those topics it has determined to be material. If any of the Topic Standards disclosures listed are not relevant to the organization’s impacts, the organization is not required to report them. However, the organization is required to list these disclosures in the GRI content index and provide ‘not applicable’ as the reason for omission for not reporting the disclosures. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

The additional sector disclosures and recommendations outline further information which has been identified as relevant for organizations in the oil and gas sector to report in relation to a topic. The organization should provide sufficient information about its impacts in relation to each material topic, so that information users can make informed assessments and decisions about the organization. For this reason, reporting these additional sector disclosures and recommendations is encouraged, however it is not a requirement.  

When the organization reports additional sector disclosures, it is required to list them in the GRI content index (see Requirement 7 in GRI 1).  

If the organization reports information that applies to more than one material topic, it does not need to repeat it for each topic. The organization can report this information once, with a clear explanation of all the topics it covers.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report on a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

See Requirement 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on using Sector Standards to report disclosures.  

# GRI Sector Standard reference numbers

# 1. Sector profile  

Oil and gas are non-renewable natural resources, used by humans for thousands of years and with particular intensity during the last two centuries. The oil and gas sector is a large global industry producing fuel for transportation and for energy generation, and raw materials for chemical products and polymers. The sector’s outputs are also used in construction, clothing, fertilizers and insecticides, medical and electronic equipment, and a range of everyday objects. The combustion of oil and gas generates air emissions, including greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are the main contributor to climate change.  

The oil and gas sector comprises organizations of different sizes and ownership status. State-owned oil and gas enterprises are present in most oil and gas resource-rich countries, representing some of the largest organizations in the sector. Privately held oil and gas organizations are also important and are, in general, vertically integrated and operate internationally. Medium-sized organizations may operate in specific regions or countries, or deliver products, services and technology, such as surveying of resources, drilling, design, planning, and construction, to exploration and production organizations.  

# Sector activities and business relationships  

Through their activities and business relationships, organizations can have an effect on the economy, environment, and people, and in turn make negative or positive contributions to sustainable development. When determining its material topics, the organization should consider the impacts of both its activities and its business relationships.  

# Activities  

The impacts of an organization vary according to the types of activities it undertakes. The following list outlines some of the key activities of the oil and gas sector, as defined in this Standard. This list is not exhaustive.  

Exploration: Surveying of resources, including aerial surveys, seismic testing, and exploratory drilling.  

Development: Design, planning, and construction of oil and gas fields, including processing and worker facilities.  

Production: Extraction of oil and gas from onshore or offshore reserves, and separation of oil, gas and water.  

Oil sands mining: Extraction of bitumen from oil sands using surface mining or in situ techniques.  

Closure and rehabilitation: Closure, decommissioning, dismantling, removal, disposal, or modification of assets, facilities and sites.  

Refining: Refining of oil into petroleum products for use as fuels and as feedstocks for chemicals.  

Processing: Processing gas into pipe-quality natural gas and natural gas liquids, including removing hydrocarbons and fluids.  

Transportation: Marine and land transportation of oil and gas.  

Storage and pipelines: Distribution and storage of oil and gas in tanks and marine vessels and distribution via marine and land-based pipelines.  

Sales and marketing: Selling of oil and gas products for the purpose of, for example, fuels, gas for retail use, and inputs in the production of specialty chemicals, petrochemicals, and polymers.  

# Business relationships  

An organization’s business relationships include relationships that it has with business partners, with entities in its value chain including those beyond the first tier, and with any other entities directly linked to its operations, products, or services. The following types of business relationships are prevalent in the oil and gas sector and are relevant when identifying the impacts of organizations in the sector.  

Joint ventures are arrangements in which organizations share the costs, benefits, and liabilities of oil and gas activities. An organization in the oil and gas sector can be involved with negative impacts as a result of a joint venture, even if it is a non-operating partner.  

State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are often the largest oil and gas producers and hold ownership of the majority of global reserves. They may also serve as joint venture partners to publicly traded oil and gas organizations. SOEs have specific challenges relating to transparency and governance, which are addressed in some of the likely material topics in this Standard.  

Suppliers and contractors are used in large numbers in the oil and gas sector to perform certain activities, such as drilling and construction, or to provide other services and products. Some of the significant impacts covered in this Standard concern the supply chain.  

Customers use oil and gas to produce energy, heat, and materials. When combusting oil and gas, they generate greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions. While the primary responsibility for reducing and managing their emissions lies with customers, organizations extracting and producing oil and gas are also expected to take actions to reduce emissions from the combustion of their products and to disclose the related GHG emissions (Scope 3 GHG emissions). As such, this Standard includes not only direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, but also other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions.  

# The sector and sustainable development  

Energy is a key driver of economic growth and sustainable development. Oil and gas have been fundamental sources of the world’s energy, contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction.  

Currently, oil and gas are the world's most actively traded commodities. Together, they represent the most important resources for electricity production, providing over $50\%$ of the total supply [13]. In 2020, $90\%$ of the transportation sector’s energy needs were met by oil products [12]. The oil and gas sector today also meets much of society’s needs for raw materials used in the production of specialty chemicals, petrochemicals, and polymers.  

At present, oil and gas are considered strategic assets in regions or countries where they generate critical revenue streams or support energy independence. For example, the percentage of gross domestic product attributable to oil revenues has reached $45\%$ in some resource-rich countries [20]. Revenues from this sector can contribute to local and national economic development, together with job creation, investments, and infrastructure, business, and skills development.  

The majority of the world’s countries have committed to combating climate change, as outlined in the Paris Agreement [7]. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that continuing to emit greenhouse gas (GHG) at the current rate could result in dangerous global temperature increases leading to magnified risks of extreme weather and climate events [15]. Other reports show that with current policy commitments the world is heading toward a dangerous $3.2^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ rise in temperature by 2100 [18].  

These projections underline the need to transition to a low-carbon economy based on affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. Achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 is required to limit global warming to $1.5^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ above pre-industrial levels, a level predicted to pose significantly lower risks to natural and human systems than that of $2^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ [15]. Combined, the GHGs released by extracting, refining, and burning oil and gas represent $55\%$ of all energyrelated GHG emissions and constitute the largest contribution to anthropogenic climate change [36]. Action taken by the oil and gas sector is essential to the transition to a low-carbon economy.  

The number of oil and gas operations closing will increase in the context of transition to a low-carbon economy, and impacts of these closures on workers and communities will consequently rise. A just transition is a fair and equitable pathway through industrial transformation to a sustainable future, where governments and organizations work in collaboration. Such a transition integrates worker-centric public policies and programs with employer policies and programs to provide a secure and decent future for all workers, their families, and the communities that rely on them. The path for transitioning to a low-carbon economy will vary for different countries according to factors such as their economic conditions and capability to respond to and mitigate impacts of climate change [9].  

Besides contributing to climate change, the activities of the oil and gas sector generate further negative impacts on the environment and people, including impacts on their human rights. These impacts include loss of biodiversity; soil, water and air pollution; conflict and social disruption, and threats to human health. Vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples or women may be disproportionally affected, and oil and gas operations may continue to generate negative impacts after their closure.  

Negative impacts can be intensified by inadequate governance of natural resources. The large revenues derived from the oil and gas sector can lead to corruption and mismanagement of resources. Economies dependent on oil and gas can also be vulnerable to commodity price and production fluctuations.  

# Sustainable Development Goals  

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the 193 United Nations (UN) member states, comprise the world’s comprehensive plan of action to achieving sustainable development [8].  

Since the SDGs and targets associated with them are integrated and indivisible, oil and gas organizations have the potential to contribute to all SDGs by enhancing their positive impacts, or by preventing and mitigating their negative impacts, on the economy, environment, and people.  

The oil and gas sector is particularly relevant to achieving Goal 13: Climate Action and, given the potential impact of climate change on the development agenda, this will influence the achievement of every goal, while contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.  

The oil and gas sector also plays a fundamental role in achieving Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. Ensuring access to energy for all while transitioning toward a low-carbon economy is one of the challenges faced by the sector. Millions of people still lack access to energy. This limitation hinders  access to basic services such as those recognized in Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing and Goal 4: Quality Education as well as their income-generating opportunities, which are crucial to achieving Goal 1: No Poverty. More broadly, affordable and reliable energy is a fundamental input for the world economy and instrumental for achieving Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.  

In countries that produce oil and gas, the sector generates high revenues and attracts significant investment. However, the large revenues derived from the sector carry a risk of corruption and conflict over resources, which have a bearing on Goal 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions.  

Table 2 presents connections between the likely material topics for the oil and gas sector and the SDGs. These links were identified based on an assessment of the impacts described in each likely material topic, the targets associated with each SDG, and existing mapping undertaken for the sector (see references [14] and [16] in the Bibliography).  

Table 2 is not a reporting tool but presents connections between the oil and gas sector’s significant impacts and the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. See references [21] and [22] in the Bibliography for information on reporting progress towards the SDGs using the GRI Standards.

# 2. Likely material topics  

This section comprises the likely material topics for the oil and gas sector. Each topic describes the sector’s most significant impacts related to the topic and lists disclosures that have been identified as relevant for reporting on the topic by oil and gas organizations. The organization is required to review each topic in this section and determine whether it is a material topic for the organization, and then to determine what information to report for its material topics.  

# Topic 11.1 GHG emissions  

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions comprise air emissions that contribute to climate change, such as carbon dioxide $(\mathsf{C O}_{2})$ and methane $(C H_{4})$ . This topic covers direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions related to an organization’s activities, as well as other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions that occur upstream and downstream of the organization’s activities.  

GHG emissions are the single biggest contributor to climate change. The oil and gas sector’s activities and the use of oil and gas products are responsible for a large portion of two major GHGs: carbon dioxide $(\mathsf{C O}_{2})$ and methane $(C H_{4}$ ). Globally, it is estimated that the sector is responsible for a quarter of all anthropogenic emissions of ${\mathsf{C H}}_{4}$ , which has a notably higher global warming potential than ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ . Recent measurements indicate that available figures on ${\mathsf{C H}}_{4}$ emissions from the sector could be underestimates. Other GHGs from oil and gas activities include ethane $(\mathsf C_{2}\mathsf H_{6})$ , nitrous oxide $(\mathsf{N}_{2}\mathsf{O})$ , hydrofluorocarbons (HCFs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride $(\mathsf{S F}_{6})$ , and nitrogen trifluoride $(\mathsf{N F}_{3})$ .  

GHG emissions from oil and gas activities are classified as direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in the case of activities owned or controlled by the organization or energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in the case of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organization. Currently, $15\%$ of the world’s energyrelated GHG emissions come from the process of producing and distributing oil and gas [36].  

Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions comprise emissions from fuel combustion during production, process emissions such as those during loading and tankage, and fugitive emissions such as those from piping and equipment leaks. A substantial source of the sector’s Scope 1 GHG emissions is flaring and venting, which aim to dispose of gas that cannot be contained or handled otherwise for safety, technical, or economic reasons. These practices occur during oil and gas production, storage, and refining.  

# Box 1. Flaring and venting  

When gas needs to be disposed of, it may be flared (burned off), or vented (released without being burned). Flaring converts gas to ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ , while venting releases ${\mathsf{C H}}_{4}$ directly to the atmosphere. Given that ${\mathsf{C H}}_{4}$ has a higher global warming potential than ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ , routing associated gases to an efficient flare system instead of venting is considered best practice and there is wide agreement that routine venting should be eliminated.  

Flaring also represents a major source of emissions. While large amounts of gases resulting from oil and gas activities are used or conserved, flaring still routinely occurs. According to the World Bank, routine flaring occurs ‘during normal oil production operations in the absence of sufficient facilities or amenable geology to re-inject the produced gas, utilize it on-site, or dispatch it to a market’. Increases in shale oil production has further contributed to volumes of flaring.  

The amount of natural gas flared in 2018 resulted in emissions of approximately 275 megatons of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ , as well as other GHGs such as methane, black carbon and ${\sf N}_{2}\sf O$ .  

See references [34], [46] and [48] in the Bibliography.  

Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions originate from stationary and mobile sources (e.g., transportation of materials, products, or waste); and the activities of extraction; oil refining; liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; and operation of facilities and equipment. The depletion of traditional oil and gas resources has led the sector to move production to more difficult settings, which may involve more complex extraction methods such as offshore deep-water drilling or oil sands mining. Despite the sector’s ongoing improvements in production efficiency, these  

conditions are likely to increase the amount of energy used during production and transportation and, as such, GHG emissions associated with from these activities.  

GHG emissions resulting from the end use of products are classified as other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions. For the oil and gas sector, these constitute the most significant GHG emissions and over half of global ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions [33]. The majority of Scope 3 GHG emissions originate from combustion processes related to construction, electricity and heat generation, manufacturing, and transportation. Volumes of these emissions have increased together with higher energy demands.

# Topic 11.2 Climate adaptation, resilience, and transition  

Climate adaptation, resilience, and transition refer to how an organization adjusts to current and anticipated climate change-related risks, as well as how it contributes to the ability of societies and economies to withstand impacts from climate change. This topic covers an organization’s strategy in relation to the transition to a lowcarbon economy and the impacts of that transition on workers and local communities.  

Signatories of the Paris Agreement have committed to keeping global warming ‘well below $2^{\circ}\mathsf{C}^{\prime}$ [58], yet fossil fuel reserves that are currently available globally far exceed the maximum amount that can be consumed while remaining within this limit [78]. This means organizations in the oil and gas sector need to establish targets for carbon emissions; modify their business models; and invest in renewable energy, technologies to remove ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ from the atmosphere [68], and nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, such as reforestation, afforestation, coastal and wetland restoration.  

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy requires organizations to set emissions targets that are consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to well below $2^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ under the Paris Agreement. Actions to reduce emissions linked to the process of extracting and distributing oil and gas, which are direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, offer important and immediate opportunities for the sector to contribute to reducing global GHG emissions. The sector also faces expectations to address indirect Scope 3 emissions related to the use of oil and gas products. Actions to reduce these emissions can include, for example, diversification into lower carbon businesses.  

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy also creates uncertainty about the future demand for oil and gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that based on current policies, demand for oil will level off around 2030 while, in some regions, demand for gas will begin decreasing by 2040 [68]. In a scenario that sees the energy transition accelerate to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, demand for oil could drop by almost $75\%$ between 2020 and 2050 and demand for gas could peak before $2030^{3}$ [67]. A decrease in the demand for oil and gas will translate into lower utilization of existing production facilities and decreased development of reserves. Depending on the speed of this process, some fields and facilities may need to be re-evaluated or even written-off prematurely, becoming stranded assets. This will affect oil and gas organizations financially and generate significant impacts for workers, governments and other stakeholders.  

The transition may affect employment, government revenues, and economic development in regions where the sector operates. More frequent closures are less likely to be counterbalanced by openings, as has been the case in the past. Workers may face other potential impacts related to employability, reskilling, and desirable re-employment opportunities. Closure of operations without adequate provisions for decommissioning and rehabilitation may also result in an economic burden for governments and local communities (see also topic 11.7 Closure and rehabilitation), particularly in countries where oil and gas production provides a large percentage of revenues.  

To achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy, the different dependency levels of workers, local communities, and national economies on the oil and gas sector needs to be recognized, and quality jobs for those affected created [79]. Examples of actions that organizations may take to contribute to a just transition include providing adequate advance notice of closures; collaborating with governments and unions; advocating for climate consistent policy (see also topic 11.22 Public policy); retraining, reskilling, and redeploying workers; and making alternative investments in the affected communities. Meaningful, early consultations with stakeholders and local communities have also been identified as crucial to achieving a just transition (see also topic 11.7 Closure and rehabilitation).  

# Box 2. Scenario analysis for climate transition  

Scenario analysis is a process that considers alternative situations to assess future outcomes. Organizations can use it to gauge the potential outcomes of their strategies in uncertain circumstances or conditions. Scenario analysis can employ various methodologies, qualitative and quantitative. The Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations suggest scenario analysis as a way to help organizations understand climate change-related risks and opportunities [82].  

Scenario analysis is well suited to explore the risks that transitioning to a low-carbon economy poses to oil and gas organizations because it allows them to consider alternative forms of future states simultaneously. Organizations typically define scenarios according to the speed of transition, expressed in the resulting average global temperature changes. A scenario compatible with the commitments of countries in the Paris Agreement will require a temperature rise well below $2^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ . Other scenarios can be defined according to an organization’s national context. The organization can then translate the expected reductions in GHG emissions compatible with such a temperature rise into expected revenue.

# Topic 11.3 Air emissions  

Air emissions include pollutants that have negative impacts on air quality, ecosystems, and human and animal health. This topic covers impacts from emissions of sulfur oxides $(\mathsf{s o}_{\mathsf{x}})$ , nitrogen oxides $(\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{x}})$ , particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), and heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium.  

The activities of the oil and gas sector and the combustion of oil and gas are anthropogenic sources of other air emissions besides greenhouse gases (GHGs). These include $\mathsf{S O}_{\mathsf{x}}$ , $\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{x}}$ , PM, VOCs, hazardous air pollutants (HAP), such as benzene $(C_{6}\mathsf{H}_{6})$ and hydrogen sulfide $(\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S})$ , and ozone $(\mathsf{O}_{3})$ ).7  

These air emissions can be released during production and processing; refining, distribution, and storage. They can result from activities such as flaring and venting; fuel combustion for powering machinery; and transportation of supplies and products. Air emissions can also result from evaporation losses, fugitive emissions from equipment leaks and failures, and process-safety incidents and events. A significant number of air emissions also result from fuel combustion by end-users.  

Globally, air pollution causes acute health problems and millions of deaths annually by contributing to heart and lung diseases, strokes, respiratory infections, and neurological damage [93]. Children, the elderly, and the poor are disproportionately affected by these emissions, as are local communities adjacent to operational sites.  

Air emissions may lead to widespread and diverse impacts on ecosystems, while affecting other economic activities that depend on these ecosystems. For example, $\mathsf{N O}_{\mathrm{x}}$ emissions that enter oceans, lakes, or other water bodies can alter their chemistry, negatively impacting land and aquatic life. $\mathsf{N O}_{\mathrm{x}}$ and $\mathsf{S O}_{\mathsf{x}}$ emissions can lead to acid rain and increase ocean acidification. These emissions can also cause damage to plant life by, for example, impairing photosynthesis and reducing growth.

# Topic 11.4 Biodiversity  

Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms. It includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. Biodiversity not only has intrinsic value, but is also vital to human health, food security, economic prosperity, and mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its impacts. This topic covers impacts on biodiversity, including on plant and animal species, genetic diversity and natural ecosystems.  

Oil and gas activities can be the source of pressures on the environments in which they occur, and have direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on biodiversity in the short and long term. Biodiversity impacts from oil and gas activities include contamination of air, soil and water, soil erosion, and sedimentation of waterways. Other impacts can include animal mortality or increased vulnerability to predators, habitat fragmentation and conversion, and the introduction of invasive species and pathogens. Impacts on biodiversity can result in limitations in the availability, accessibility, or quality of natural resources, which in turn may impact the well-being and livelihoods of local communities (topic 11.15) and indigenous peoples (topic 11.17). Impacts can be exacerbated when activities occur in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value and may extend well beyond the closure and rehabilitation (topic 11.7) of operational sites or geographic boundaries of activities.  

Impacts can result from both onshore and offshore activities, such as land clearance; seismic testing and drilling of exploration wells; construction of assets and facilities, infrastructure, and pipelines; road development and transportation; water discharge; disposal of drilling waste; spills and leaks. Threats to biodiversity will increase as easily accessible oil and gas resources are depleted and oil and gas activities move into more remote areas.  

The oil and gas sector can also contribute to cumulative impacts on biodiversity. For example, as onshore oil and gas activities expand into an area, new access routes are installed, which typically require clearing land. This leads to habitat fragmentation and conversion but can also result in increased use of the area, or even encourage other sectors to establish operations in the same areas, intensifying impacts. Changes to land use to accommodate the sector’s activities can exacerbate the effects of climate change if they result in removal of carbon sinks. In turn, climate change is likely to affect all aspects of biodiversity, including individual organisms, populations, species distribution, and the composition and function of ecosystems, and the impacts are anticipated to worsen with increasing temperatures.  

To limit and manage its impacts on biodiversity, the oil and gas sector has been developing and, in some cases already using, a mitigation hierarchy tool that helps inform its actions. The mitigation hierarchy consists of four sequential steps to reduce the negative impacts of activities on the environment. Priority is given to preventive measures starting with avoidance of negative impacts and, where avoidance is not possible, to minimization of those impacts. When negative impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, remediation measures may be used, such as rehabilitation or restoration of biodiversity. Offsetting measures may also be applied to residual impacts after all other measures have been applied (see reference [118] in the Bibliography).

# Topic 11.5 Waste  

Waste refers to anything that a holder discards, intends to discard, or is required to discard. When inadequately managed, waste can have negative impacts on the environment and human health, which can extend beyond the locations where waste is generated and discarded. This topic covers impacts from waste, including as a result of construction and rehabilitation activities.  

Oil and gas activities typically generate high volumes of waste, including hazardous waste. The largest waste streams derive from the extraction or processing of oil and gas and can consist of drilling muds and cuttings, scale, and sludges, which in turn, can contain chemical additives, hydrocarbons, metals, naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and salts. These waste streams may contaminate surface water, groundwater, seawater with chemicals or heavy metals, and negatively impact plant and animal species as well as human health. Impacts can depend on an organization’s approach to waste management, regulation, and on availability of recovery and disposal facilities in the proximity of activities.  

Waste streams that cannot be reduced, or diverted from disposal, are typically stored, treated or disposed through various methods. When disposed of in underground injection wells, drilling waste can trigger seismicity or lead to groundwater contamination. In some offshore operations, drilling fluids might also be discharged into waterways or the ocean, depending on regulation and the availability of alternative outlets. If waste is disposed of on land or if hazardous substances from waste storage facilities leach into the ground, other impacts can include contamination of land, loss of land productivity, and erosion.  In remote areas with limited recovery and disposal methods, waste impacts can be more severe or harder to monitor.  

In oil sands mining, the largest waste stream is tailings, a hazardous waste stream produced during the process of separating oil from sand (see topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management). Some tailings ponds have been found to leach chemicals, causing health risks for local communities and wildlife.  

When operations end, closure and rehabilitation activities usually involve the final disposal of hazardous chemicals and managing substantial quantities of materials from disused structures or equipment (see topic 11.7 Closure and rehabilitation). Other typical wastes from oil and gas activities include waste oils, construction waste, and domestic and office waste.  

# Box 3. Use of materials  

The type and quantity of materials used by an organization in the oil and gas sector can signify its dependence on natural resources and its impacts on their availability. Related environmental impacts depend on the organization’s approach to sourcing, use, and disposal of these materials.  

Oil and gas extraction, development, production, and processing activities represent a large proportion of the sector’s use of materials. Concrete, cement, steel and other metals are necessary to construct offshore platforms and onshore facilities, as well as for the equipment and infrastructure needed to extract, process and transport oil and gas (e.g., valves, tubing and pipelines). Large volumes of chemicals are used during drilling and well completion.  

The oil and gas sector has opportunities for efficient use of materials. These include using  its significant purchasing power to create demand for more responsibly produced materials or implementing circularity measures that aim at reusing or recycling materials from disused structures, such as steel and concrete.  

The use of materials is addressed in GRI 301: Materials 2016.

# Topic 11.6 Water and effluents  

Recognized as a human right, access to fresh water is essential for human life and well-being. The amount of water withdrawn and consumed by an organization and the quality of its discharges can have impacts on ecosystems and people. This topic covers impacts related to the withdrawal and consumption of water and the quality of water discharged.  

Oil and gas activities can reduce water availability for local communities and other sectors that also rely on the resource. They can have impacts on the quality of surface water, groundwater and seawater, which can translate into long-term impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity (topic 11.4), cause health and development problems for humans, and impair food security.  

Extraction and processing are the oil and gas sector activities that use the largest volumes of water. The quantity of water required for these activities vary according to the oil and gas extraction method, local geology, and the degree of processing required. Some extraction or processing methods, including hydraulic fracturing and oil sands mining are particularly water intensive. The amount of water withdrawn for certain activities also varies according to an organization’s ability to substitute the use of freshwater, the quality of water required, recycling infrastructure and the characteristics of local water resources.  

Oil and gas organizations may also need to manage large quantities of produced water or process wastewater, which typically contain hydrocarbons, chemicals, or other hazardous substances. To minimize water impacts, produced water and process wastewater may be reinjected for well stimulation or reused in other processes. If not, they may be discharged to surface water, groundwater, seawater, or a third party; dispersed over land; or stored in evaporation ponds. When discharged, the impacts to water vary according to the sensitivity of the receiving waterbody and the quality of the water discharged.  

Contamination can also result from the injection of drilling fluids into wells and flowback from hydraulic fracturing. This can cause underground contaminants to seep and pollute groundwater resources. Inefficient treatment of water discharges, oil spills from transportation accidents, ruptured pipelines or seepage, or failure of an oil sands tailings dam can also have similar impacts on water quality (see topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management).  

The oil and gas sector’s impacts on water additionally depend on the quantity of local water resources; where water is scarce, the sector has a greater impact. A large proportion of the world’s oil and gas resources are found in areas that are arid or experience water stress. In such areas, the sector’s activities are likely to increase competition for water in demand for other uses – such as for household use and fishing, aquaculture, or agricultural activities. This may exacerbate tensions between, as well as within, sectors or local communities. Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events related to climate change will likely pose more frequent challenges related to water availability and quality in the future.

# Topic 11.7 Closure and rehabilitation  

At the end of commercial use, organizations are expected to close assets and facilities and rehabilitate operational sites. Impacts can occur during and after closure. This topic covers an organization’s approach to closure and rehabilitation, including how the organization considers the impacts on the environment, local communities, and workers.  

Oil and gas facilities can continue to generate environmental impacts after closure, including soil and water contamination, changes to landforms, and disturbance of biodiversity and wildlife. Closure can also lead to lasting impacts on local communities. Failure to close facilities and rehabilitate sites effectively can render land unusable for other productive purposes and can result in health and safety hazards due to contamination or to the presence of hazardous materials.  

Closure and rehabilitation of oil and gas fields can include removal and final disposal of hazardous substances and chemicals; capping or plugging  abandoned wells; dismantling structures and reusing, recycling or disposing materials. It can also include the management of waste; surface water and groundwater quality issues resulting from spills and leaks; and restoration of lands to a condition or economic value equivalent to the pre-development state. Closing oil sands mining sites also involves managing tailings ponds (see also topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management).  

Several international conventions (see references [168], [169] and [170] in the Bibliography) require decommissioning and removing all offshore structures at the end of field life. However, these requirements may be subject to different interpretations across countries, where national regulations or regional conventions can take precedence over international conventions. As a result, organizations in the oil and gas sector may lack clear rules for filing decommissioning plans with local governments and taking action on them once offshore structures become disused.  

Decommissioning and dismantling offshore structures can be costly and complex due to their size, weight, and location. There may be additional complexities and environmental considerations when, for example, structures that should be removed become part of benthic  communities and habitats. In some cases, decommissioning can occur in situ and structures may be left in place. When this happens, impacts can include marine pollution from corrosion, ecosystem changes, damage to fishing equipment, and navigational hazards to shipping.  

The closure and rehabilitation phase may offer additional employment opportunities to local communities. However, once this phase is completed, workers may be retrenched and local communities may face economic downturn and social disruption if they have come to depend on the oil and gas sector’s activities for employment as well as for income, taxes and other payments to governments, community development, and other benefits.  

To anticipate potential impacts, planning for closure often requires planning in the early phases of a project. Impacts from closure can be exacerbated if there is insufficient notice or lack of adequate planning for economic revitalization, social protection, and labor transition. Without clearly assigned responsible parties or allocated funds, closed oil and gas facilities can leave a legacy of environmental issues and financial burdens for communities and governments. The need to reduce GHG emissions and to transition to a low-carbon economy (see topic 11.2 Climate adaptation, resilience and transition) is expected to lead to more frequent closures. These are less likely to be counterbalanced by openings, as has been the case in the past. Collaboration between local and national governments and organizations, as well as with workers and unions, is necessary to mitigate significant impacts  and ensure a just transition.  

Technological solutions that would allow repurposing or extending the life of assets after production ceases (e.g., using pipelines for ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ storage or transport of low-carbon fuels) are being tested, but have yet to be proven effective and economically viable.

# Topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management  

Asset integrity and critical incident management deal with the prevention and control of incidents that can lead to fatalities, injuries or ill health, environmental impacts, and damage to local communities and infrastructure. This topic covers impacts from such incidents and an organization’s approach to managing them.  

Critical incidents in the oil and gas sector can have catastrophic consequences for workers, local communities (see topic 11.9 Occupational health and safety and topic 11.15 Local communities), the environment and cause damage to organizations’ assets. In addition to fatalities and injuries, these incidents can cause air, soil, and water contamination. These impacts have the potential to disrupt other economic activities that depend on these natural resources, such as fishing and agriculture, affecting livelihoods, and compromising food safety and security. They can also lead to ecosystem and habitat degradation and animal mortality.  

Critical incidents related to the oil and gas sector include loss of control or containment of hydrocarbons, well blowout, explosions, fires, unplanned plant disruption and shutdown, and tailings dam failures from operations related to oil sands. Oil and gas spills and leaks, for example due to undetected failures in equipment or which occur during distribution of oil and gas by marine, road, or rail transport or pipelines,  may pollute the soil and water as well as harm species (see also topic 11.6 Water and effluents and topic 11.4 Biodiversity). Events or incidents involving methane and other GHG emissions also contribute to climate change (see topic 11.1 GHG emissions).  

Organizations in the oil and gas sector can prevent critical incidents with an effective process safety management system. Process safety refers to the systematic application of good design, construction, and operating principles to ensure the safe containment of hazardous materials; it also addresses the sources or factors that lead to potential incidents. A process safety management system can also limit impacts associated with critical incidents related to extreme weather events, which are likely to increase in frequency and intensity due to the effects of climate change.  

# Box 4. Oil sands tailings  

Oil sands mining typically uses large amounts of water to separate bitumen from sand. This generates tailings, which contain large quantities of hazardous waste, including hydrocarbons and heavy metals. On average, 1.5 barrels of tailings get stored for each barrel of bitumen produced.  

Tailings facilities for oil sands mining present considerable asset integrity risks. Available technology to treat oil sand tailings currently fails to manage this waste effectively. As a result, tailings continue to accumulate in ponds, which cover increasingly vast areas of land. Poor design or management of tailing ponds can cause leaks or dam failures, polluting the surrounding surface water, groundwater, or cause critical incidents that may have severe impacts on the local environment and communities.

# Topic 11.9 Occupational health and safety  

Healthy and safe work conditions are recognized as a human right. Occupational health and safety involves the prevention of physical and mental harm to workers and promotion of workers’ health. This topic covers impacts related to workers’ health and safety.  

Many work-related hazards are associated with activities undertaken in the oil and gas sector, such as working with heavy machinery and exposure to or handling of explosive, flammable, poisonous, or harmful substances. Despite efforts to eliminate work-related hazards and improve workers’ health and well-being, work-related injuries and ill health, including fatalities, are still prevalent in the sector.  

Hazards associated with the activities of the oil and gas sector have the potential to result in high-consequence workrelated injuries. Transportation incidents, which can occur when workers and equipment are transported to and from wells, offshore rigs and other facilities, are the most common source of fatalities and injuries in the sector. Other major hazards include fire and explosions, which can originate from flammable gases or liquids during oil and gas production and transportation, and electrical hazards associated with high-voltage systems used in exploration and production facilities or equipment. Falling structures, faulty handling of heavy machinery, or malfunctioning electrical, hydraulic, or mechanical installations can result in incidents categorized as ‘struck-by’, ‘caught-in’, or ‘caughtbetween’. Workers may also be at risk of injuries from slips, trips, and falls when accessing high platforms and equipment.  

Hazards associated with the oil and gas sector that have the potential to result in ill health can be biological, chemical, ergonomic, or physical in origin. Commonly reported chemical hazards include respirable crystalline silica, which is released during hydraulic fracturing, for example, and can cause silicosis and lung cancer. Hydrogen sulfide released from oil and gas wells and harmful hydrocarbon gases and vapors are other commonly reported hazards. The sector’s activities also involve working in confined spaces, which may contain a high concentration of gases, such as carbon monoxide, methane, and nitrogen, that can lead to poisoning or asphyxiation. Physical and ergonomic hazards in the sector include extreme temperatures, harmful levels of radiation, and harmful levels of machinery noise or vibration, which can cause hearing impairment or loss and musculoskeletal disorders. Biological hazards prevalent in the sector include communicable diseases present in the local community or diseases due to poor hygiene and poor quality of food or water.  

Hazards related to common employment practices (topic 11.10) in the oil and gas sector can increase the risk of fatigue, strain, or stress and impact physical, psychological, and social health. These practices include fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work arrangements, working and living in different locations, rotational work, long shifts, long travel times, living in the workplace, interrupted rest, irregular working hours, and solitary work. Workers may also experience psychological reactions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder following a major incident. In addition, workplaces characterized by gender imbalance can contribute to increased stress, discrimination, or sexual harassment (see also topic 11.11 Diversity and non-discrimination).  

The oil and gas sector makes extensive use of suppliers, some of which may undertake activities considered among the most dangerous. Occupational health and safety management systems may not cover suppliers’ workers in the same way employees are covered. Suppliers’ workers operating on the premises of organizations in the sector may be less familiar with the workplace and the organization’s health and safety practices or less committed to those practices. Other workers in the organization’s supply chain may be subject to lower occupational health and safety standards.

# Topic 11.10 Employment practices  

Employment practices refer to an organization’s approach to job creation, terms of employment and working conditions for its workers. This topic also covers the employment and working conditions in an organization’s supply chain.  

The oil and gas sector generates employment opportunities across the value chain. This can have positive socioeconomic impacts on communities, countries, and regions. While the sector usually offers well-paid opportunities for skilled workers, employment practices in the sector are also associated with negative impacts. Examples include impacts related to disparities in working conditions for contract workers, ineffective labormanagement consultations, and job insecurity.  

Many jobs in the oil and gas sector have complex shift patterns, involving long shifts and night shifts, to ensure continuity of operations around the clock. This can cause high levels of fatigue and augment risks related to health and safety (see topic 11.9 Occupational health and safety) if organizations do not provide for sufficient rest time. Organizations in the oil and gas sector may also use fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work arrangements, in which workers are flown to operational sites for several weeks at a time and often required to work extended shifts. Workers on marine vessels can also be at risk of remaining at sea for extended periods of time. Irregular work shifts and schedules, time spent away from families, and potentially limited communication facilities can further impact workers’  physical, psychological, and/or social health.  

Various activities in the oil and gas sector are outsourced to suppliers. This is common during peak periods, such as during construction or maintenance works, or for specific activities, such as catering, drilling, security, and transportation. Outsourcing activities and using workers employed by suppliers could allow organizations in the oil and gas sector to reduce their labor costs or to bypass collective agreements that are in place for employees (see also topic 11.13 Freedom of association and collective bargaining).  

Compared to employees, workers employed by suppliers commonly have less favorable employment conditions, lower remuneration, less training, higher accident rates, and less job security. They often lack social protection and access to grievance mechanisms. Workers beyond the first tiers of business relationships in organizations’ supply chains may also be subject to low standards for working conditions, exposing organizations in the oil and gas sector to human rights violations through their business relationships (see also topic 11.12 Forced labor and modern slavery).  

Employment terms can vary between local workers, migrant workers, and contract workers. Remuneration for these groups of workers may be unequal, while benefits, such as bonuses, housing allowances, and private insurance plans, may only be offered to some migrant workers. Lack of relevant skills, knowledge, or accessible training programs can also restrict local communities from accessing employment opportunities created by the oil and gas sector (see also topic 11.14 Economic impacts).  

Job security is also a concern in the oil and gas sector. Closure (topic 11.7) or oil price drops can occur suddenly, leading to job losses and increasing pressure on remaining workers. Low job security is further compounded by automation and changing business models, such as changes triggered by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Organizations in the sector can support workers by planning for a just transition, including implementing timely measures that aim to develop their skills and improve their employability in other sectors.

# Topic 11.11 Non-discrimination and equal opportunity  

Freedom from discrimination is a human right and a fundamental right at work. Discrimination can impose unequal burdens on individuals or deny fair opportunities on the basis of individual merit. This topic covers impacts from discrimination and practices related to diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity.  

The conditions, locations, necessary skills, and types of work associated with the oil and gas sector can be a barrier for entry, hinder employee diversity, and result in discrimination. Discriminatory practices can impede access to jobs and career development, as well as lead to inequalities in treatment, remuneration, and benefits.  

Documented cases of discrimination in the oil and gas sector concern race, color, sex, gender, disability, religion, national extraction, and worker status. For example, jobseekers from local communities may be excluded from the hiring process because of a recruitment system bias that favors a dominant ethnic group or utilizes migrant workers. Compared to some migrant workers, local workers may receive significantly lower pay for equal work. The sector's widespread use of contract workers, often with differing terms of employment, can also be conducive to discrimination.  

The oil and gas sector is characterized by a significant gender imbalance. In many countries, the percentage of women working in this sector is significantly lower than the percentage of women working overall nationwide. Women are also significantly underrepresented in senior management positions. One cause of this imbalance may be that fewer women graduate with degrees pertinent to the sector, such as in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Other barriers for women and primary caregivers include fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work arrangements, long hours, and limited parental leave. Social or cultural customs, beliefs, and biases can also limit women’s access to jobs in this sector or prevent them from taking on specific roles. In addition, some resource-rich countries have laws that prevent women from working in hazardous or arduous occupations.  

Understanding how specific groups may be subject to discrimination across different locations where organizations in the oil and gas sector operate can help organizations effectively address discriminatory practices. Other measures, such as providing specific training to workers on preventing discrimination can help address impacts related to discrimination and create a respectful workplace.

# Topic 11.12 Forced labor and modern slavery  

Forced labor is defined as all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of penalty and for which a person has not offered themselves voluntarily. Freedom from forced labor is a human right and a fundamental right at work. This topic covers an organization’s approach to identifying and addressing forced labor and modern slavery.  

As part of a global effort, several governments have issued legislation requiring public reporting on addressing traditional and emerging practices of forced labor, including modern slavery. Such legislation applies to many organizations in the oil and gas sector.  

The large number of suppliers that organizations in the oil and gas sector interact with may include those operating in countries with low rates of enforcement of human rights and those lacking the capacity to prevent and mitigate negative human rights impacts within their own supply chains. Through their supply chains, oil and gas organizations may therefore be involved with violations of human rights and other instances of exploitation. Oil and gas organizations may also be involved with incidences of forced labor and modern slavery as a result of their joint ventures and other business relationships, including those with state-owned enterprises in countries where international human rights violations are documented. Conducting due diligence within the large and complex supply chains that commonly exist in the sector may also pose difficulties for detecting and addressing incidents of forced labor and modern slavery.  

Documented cases have shown forced labor and modern slavery in the supply of services to oil fields and offshore platforms, such as in catering, cleaning, construction, maintenance, and waste management, as well as in marine and land transportation activities. For example, a higher risk of human rights violations may be found aboard ships registered in countries other than the country of the ship’s beneficial owner. In such cases, layers of management and the use of external crewing companies can obscure accountability for ensuring respect of human rights. In other situations, inadequate arrangements by the employer to cover flight costs or facilitate border-crossing requirements at the end of a contract period have left ship workers stranded onboard and vulnerable to exploitation. Offshore oil and gas workers can also be at higher risk of forced labor due to the isolation of extraction sites, making it challenging for organizations in the sector to reinforce measures countering exploitation. Migrant workers can also face higher risks of modern slavery when dealing with third-party employment agencies, such as those who have been found to overcharge workers for visas and flights or to demand recruitment costs be paid by employees rather than employers.  

# Box 5. Impacts on children’s rights  

The risk of child labor in the oil and gas sector arises mainly through an organization’s business relationships and complex supply chains. Child labor may occur in activities that service the oil and gas sector or its workers (e.g., child labor in hospitality services or in specific sector activities, such as the manufacturing). Suppliers may operate in countries with minimum working ages that are below the minimum age set by the International Labour Organization.  

Other impacts on children’s rights and well-being can result from the proximity of an oil or gas project to local communities (topic 11.15). These impacts can include sexual violence, environmental impacts, or impacts resulting from land use and resettlement. Parents’ working conditions, including irregular working hours, long shifts, and fly-in fly-out (FIFO) arrangements, can also have impacts on children (see also topic 11.10 Employment practices).  

Child labor is addressed in GRI 408: Child Labor 2016.

# Topic 11.13 Freedom of association and collective bargaining  

Freedom of association and collective bargaining are human rights and fundamental rights at work. They include the rights of employers and workers to form, join, and run their own organizations without prior authorization or interference, and to collectively negotiate working conditions and terms of employment. This topic covers an organization’s approach and impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining.  

Workers’ rights to organize and to take collective action are critical for supporting and improving working conditions in the oil and gas sector, including conditions relating to occupational health and safety (topic 11.9), wages, and job security. These rights can also enable public debate about the sector’s governance and practices as well as aid in reducing social inequality.  

Many jobs associated with the oil and gas sector have traditionally been represented by trade unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, some oil and gas resources are located in countries where these rights are restricted. Workers in such locations face risks when seeking to join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining. Even in countries where unions are legal, existing restrictions might prevent effective worker representation, and workers who join unions may face intimidation or unfair treatment. In cases where freedom of association and collective bargaining are restricted, organizations in the oil and gas sector may employ alternative means of worker representation and engagement.  

Documented cases of interference with freedom of association and collective bargaining in the sector include detention of managers and other employees, invasion of privacy, not adhering to collective agreements, and preventing trade union access to workplaces to assist workers. Other documented cases include refusal to bargain in good faith with workers’ chosen trade unions, unfair dismissal of trade union members and leaders, and unilateral cancellation of collective bargaining agreements.  

Widely used in the oil and gas sector, contract workers are often excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements. As a result, contract workers commonly have less favorable employment conditions and lower remuneration compared to employees (see also topic 11.10 Employment practices).  

# Box 6. Freedom of association and civic space  

Freedom of association and peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights. These rights give workers, through their trade unions, and citizens, through independent civil society, the freedom to speak about the oil and gas sector’s policies and organizations’ practices without interference.  

Restrictions imposed on civic space, which is the environment that enables civil society to contribute to decisions that affect individual lives, can limit citizens’ ability to engage in public debate about the sector’s policies and organizations’ practices.

# Topic 11.14 Economic impacts  

An organization’s impacts on the economy refers to how the value it generates affects economic systems. For example, as a result of its procurement practices and employment of workers. Infrastructure investments and services supported by an organization can also have impacts on a community’s well-being and long-term development. This topic covers economic impacts at local, national, and global levels.  

Oil and gas activities can be an important source of investment and income for local communities, countries, and regions. Impacts can vary according to the scale of operations and the importance of the activity in the economic context. In some resource-rich countries, revenues from the oil and gas sector are a significant source of income. However, mismanagement of these revenues can also be harmful to economic performance and lead to macroeconomic instability and distortions (see topic 11.21 Payments to governments and topic 11.20 Anti-corruption). Economies dependent on oil and gas can also be vulnerable to commodity price and production fluctuations.  

The oil and gas sector can have positive impacts by providing revenues, derived from paying taxes and royalties, and by investing in infrastructure, such as power utilities that improve access to energy, or public services. The sector can also have positive impacts through local employment and local procurement. Skills development of local communities through education and training can help increase access to jobs in the sector. Local employment, in turn, can lead to increased purchasing power and positive impacts on local businesses. Local procurement of products and services can also help supplier development.  

The extent to which local communities stand to benefit from the presence of oil and gas activities depends on the existing development and industrialization levels of the communities, the communities’ capacity to offer qualified workers for the new employment opportunities, and the commitment of organizations in the oil and gas sector to train local workers. The net employment impacts also depend on how employment by the oil and gas sector affects existing employment in other sectors and organizations’ employment practices (topic 11.10). For example, a fly-in flyout (FIFO) work arrangement can offset pressures associated with influxes of people to small communities while still supplying the necessary workers (see also topic 11.15 Local communities). However, this arrangement reduces the employment opportunities available to local communities, detracting from the potential economic benefits.  

The introduction of new oil and gas activities can generate negative impacts on local communities, such as economic disparity, with vulnerable groups often being disproportionately affected (see also topic 11.17 Rights of indigenous peoples). Small local suppliers that depend on larger oil and gas organizations for their income generation may face challenges in cases of extended payment delays or pressures to deliver services and products at decreased rates. An influx of external workers can increase pressure on housing, infrastructure, and public services. Local communities may also have to deal with environmental legacy costs or ineffective rehabilitation after closure (see also topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management and topic 11.7 Closure and rehabilitation).  

The transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to lead to decreased activity in the oil and gas sector (see also topic 11.2 Climate adaptation, resilience, and transition), making communities and countries that depend on the sector for revenues or employment more vulnerable to the resulting economic downturn. In these cases, collaboration between local and national governments and organizations in the sector is essential to ensure a just transition.

# Topic 11.15 Local communities  

Local communities comprise individuals living or working in areas that are affected or that could be affected by an organization’s activities. An organization is expected to conduct community engagement to understand the vulnerabilities of local communities and how they may be affected by the organization’s activities. This topic covers socioeconomic, cultural, health, and human rights impacts on local communities.  

Organizations in the oil and gas sector can have positive economic impacts on local communities through employment and local procurement, taxes, or other payments to local governments, as well as through community development programs and investments in infrastructure or public services (see also topic 11.14 Economic impacts, topic 11.10 Employment practices, and topic 11.21 Payments to governments).  

Activities of the oil and gas sector can also lead to negative impacts on local communities. Negative impacts can result from, for example, land use requirements for the sector’s activities, an influx of people seeking employment and economic opportunities, environmental degradation, exposure to hazardous substances, and use of natural resources. When operating in areas of pre-existing conflict or where negative impacts from oil and gas activities are not addressed, conflicts can arise or become exacerbated (see also topic 11.18 Conflict and security). Vulnerable groups, including women and indigenous peoples, may be disproportionally affected by these impacts.  

The oil and gas sector’s land use can compete with other land use demands, such as for farming, fishing, or recreation. In addition, it can disrupt traditional livelihoods and increase the risk of impoverishment. It can eventually lead to displacement, which results in additional impacts such as restrictions on access to essential services, and impacts on human rights (see topic 11.16 Land and resource rights). The activities of the sector can also result in damage to cultural heritage sites, potentially leading to loss of tradition, culture, or cultural identity, especially among indigenous peoples (see also topic 11.17 Rights of indigenous peoples).  

The influx of workers from the surrounding areas or as a result of use of fly-in fly-out (FIFO) arrangements, particularly during the construction, maintenance, and closure and rehabilitation phases of oil and gas projects might lead to greater economic inequality within the local community. A large-scale influx of workers can place local services and resources under pressure, induce inflation, and introduce new communicable diseases. Higher housing costs may lead to an increase in homelessness, especially among vulnerable groups. There may be an increase in activities that compromise social order, such as substance abuse, gambling, and prostitution, especially affecting vulnerable groups. The influx of predominantly male workers can change the gender balance of local communities. This can impact women in particular, as it can lead to a rise in sexual violence and trafficking. Documented cases have also shown domestic and gender-based violence, both on operational sites and in local communities.  

Oil and gas activities can generate air, soil, and water pollution; increased levels of traffic, noise, light, and odors; waste streams and leaks; and dust. Activities may also cause incidents such as explosions, fires, spills, and tailings dam or pipeline failures (see also topic 11.8 Asset integrity and critical incident management). Documented cases have also shown that seismic activity induced by hydraulic fracturing can affect local communities.  

Effective local community engagement, grievance mechanisms, and other remediation processes can help organizations in the oil and gas sector prevent and mitigate the impacts of their activities. In their absence, the concerns of the community might not be understood or addressed, which can create negative impacts or exacerbate existing problems, such as gender inequality. Establishing or participating in grievance mechanisms and other remediation processes that are tailored to the specific needs of local communities can also help organizations address actual or potential negative impacts.

# Topic 11.16 Land and resource rights  

Land and resource rights encompass the rights to use, manage and control land, fisheries, forests, and other natural resources. An organization’s impacts on the availability and accessibility of these can affect local communities and other users. This topic covers impacts from an organization’s use of land and natural resources on human rights and tenure rights, including from resettlement of local communities.  

Oil and gas activities require access to land for prospecting, exploration, extraction, construction, waste storage and disposal, processing, transportation, and distribution of products. This can sometimes lead to displacement of other land users, restricted access to resources, and involuntary resettlement of local communities. Impacts from land use vary according to methods of extraction, resource location, the processing required, and transportation methods. For example, onshore oil and gas pipelines can have a large footprint due to their length and safety buffer zones.  

Unclear rules regarding tenure rights to access, use, and control land, often lead to disputes, economic and social tensions, and conflict. Insufficient consultation with, and inadequate compensation to affected communities can also exacerbate tensions and conflict. For example, the relationship between mineral rights and land rights might be unclear; formal statutory tenure rules might overlap or conflict with traditional customary rules; legitimate rights may not be recognized or enforced; or people may lack formal documentation of their rights to land.  

Involuntary resettlement of local communities can involve physical displacement (e.g., relocation or shelter loss) and economic displacement (e.g., loss or access to assets), having impacts on people’s livelihoods and human rights. In such cases, organizations in the oil and gas sector may provide local communities with monetary compensation or land that is equivalent to the lost assets. However, determining the value of local communities’ access to the natural environment is complex. It includes consideration of income-generating activities, human health, and non-material aspects of quality of life, such as the loss of cultural or recreational opportunities. The amount of compensation provided may therefore not be equivalent to the loss borne. In some cases, customary titleholders to the land may not be compensated at all or only for crops that they were cultivating on the land but not for the land itself.  

Community members resisting resettlement may also face threats and intimidation, violent, repressive, or lifethreatening removal from lands (see also topic 11.18 Conflict and security).  

Addressing impacts on land and resource rights typically requires extensive and meaningful engagement between organizations in the oil and gas sector and local communities, including vulnerable groups. In cases of ineffective community consultation or in the absence of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), impacts on resettling communities or existing problems within a community can be exacerbated by an inadequate resettlement process or lack of transparency (see also topic 11.15 Local communities and topic 11.17 Rights of indigenous peoples). Community consultations may also fail to include all affected members. Women, for example, are often excluded from decision-making processes related to the development a new project.

# Topic 11.17 Rights of indigenous peoples  

Indigenous peoples are considered a vulnerable group and are at higher risk of experiencing negative impacts more severely as a result of an organization’s activities. Indigenous peoples have both collective and individual rights, as set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other authoritative international human rights instruments. This topic covers impacts on the rights of indigenous peoples.  

The presence of the oil and gas sector in proximity to indigenous communities can present economic opportunities and benefits for indigenous peoples through employment, training, and community development programs (see also topic 11.14 Economic impacts). However, it can also disrupt indigenous peoples’ cultural, spiritual, and economic ties to their lands or natural environments, compromise their rights and well-being, and cause displacement (see also topic 11.16 Land and resource rights). It can also have an impact on the availability of and access to water, which is a key concern for many indigenous communities.  

The collective and individual rights of indigenous peoples are recognized in authoritative international instruments. Indigenous peoples also often have a special legal status in national legislation and can be customary or legal owners of lands to which organizations in the oil and gas sector are granted use rights by governments. Before initiating development or other activities that could have potential impacts on lands or resources that indigenous peoples use or own, organizations are expected to seek free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) from indigenous peoples. This right is recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and allows indigenous peoples to give or withhold consent to a project that may affect them or their territories and to negotiate project conditions [314]. However, some national governments may not recognize or enforce indigenous land rights or indigenous peoples’ rights to consent. Documented cases show an absence of good faith consultations and undue pressure on indigenous peoples to accept projects, with opposition to such projects sometimes leading to violence or death (see also topic 11.18 Conflict and security). Organizations in the sector and indigenous peoples regularly have disputes and conflicts over land ownership and rights.  

An influx of workers from other areas can result in discrimination toward indigenous peoples regarding access to jobs and opportunities. It can further undermine their social cohesion, well-being, and safety. Impacts that may affect indigenous women more severely than men include risks of prostitution, forced labor, violence, and increased exposure to communicable diseases (see also topic 11.15 Local communities).  

The contribution of the oil and gas sector to climate change can also exacerbate negative impacts on indigenous peoples, given their unique relationship with and, at times, dependence on the natural environment.

# Topic 11.18 Conflict and security  

An organization’s activities may trigger conflict or, in cases of existing conflict, intensify it. The use of security personnel to manage conflict can play an essential role in allowing an organization to operate safely and productively but also has the potential to impact on people’s human rights. This topic covers the organization's security practices and its approach to operating in areas of conflict.  

Many organizations in the oil and gas sector operate in locations and situations of conflict including, for example, countries characterized by political and social instability.  

Conflict can also be caused by the presence of oil and gas activities. It can be triggered by negative environmental impacts; inadequate engagement of stakeholders and indigenous peoples in decision-making processes; uneven distribution of economic benefits or provision of benefits deemed disproportionate to impacts created; and disputes over the use of land and natural resources (see also topic 11.16 Land and resource rights). The perceived mismanagement of funds at the expense of local interests can also trigger conflict (see also topic 11.20 Anticorruption). Such conflict can heighten the need to use security personnel, thereby increasing the potential for violations of human rights.  

Security personnel engaged by organizations in the oil and gas sector or public security directed by the host government may be present to protect organizations’ assets or ensure workers’ safety and security. Actions taken by security personnel against local community members, including during protest activities against development of oil and gas resources or to protect land and resources, can violate human rights, such as the rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech, as well as lead to violence, injuries, or deaths.  

When oil and gas activities are endorsed by the government but remain disagreeable to local communities, the presence of public security forces can increase tensions between communities, government, and organizations in the sector. This can in turn exacerbate local power imbalances and, potentially, use of force.  

In cases where public or other third-party security forces, such as paramilitary groups, are active, organizations in the oil and gas sector still have a responsibility to take steps to ensure security practices are consistent with the protection of human rights. This involves assessing security-related risks, identifying situations in which impacts on human rights are likely to occur, and working with security providers to ensure human rights are respected.  

Organizations in the oil and gas sector may also contribute more broadly to the safety and security of local communities, for example, by facilitating communication between communities and public security forces or supporting efforts to address other sources of conflict.

Anti-competitive behavior refers to actions by an organization that can result in collusion with potential competitors, abuse of dominant market position or exclusion of potential competitors, thereby limiting the effects of market competition. This can include fixing prices or coordinating bids, creating market or output restrictions, imposing geographic quotas, and allocating customers, suppliers, geographic areas, or product lines. This topic covers impacts as a result of anti-competitive behavior.  

The oil and gas sector faces high barriers to entry due to the sizable investments needed. Consequently, established organizations in the sector are often large and can dominate national or local markets. Mergers and acquisitions can intensify this concentration. Some segments of the sector depend on extensive infrastructure investments, such as investments in pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, usually operated by a single organization or a small number of them.  

The global market for oil and gas is large and well-integrated, making it secure against collusion or market dominance from individual producers. However, specific segments of the oil and gas sector can be subject to anticompetitive behavior. Instances of cartels, monopolistic practices, and related abuse of such positions have been documented in some jurisdictions in which oil and gas organizations are active. Agreements between producers and energy distributors, as well as mergers between organizations in the sector, can diminish competition by affecting output volume, and can create monopolies over transportation, distribution and supply to consumers. Collusion can also take place when submitting bids for the rights to extract oil and gas. Organizations may coordinate their bids in connivance with competitors so as to obtain lower prices, depriving resource owners of fair compensation.  

Anti-competitive behavior can result in higher prices for oil, gas and raw materials derived from oil and gas extraction. Given the key role of oil and gas in the world economy, even a small increase in price can have sizeable negative impacts.

# Topic 11.20 Anti-corruption  

Anti-corruption refers to how an organization manages the potential of being involved with corruption. Corruption is practices such as bribery, facilitation payments, fraud, extortion, collusion, money laundering, or the offer or receipt of an inducement to do something dishonest or illegal. This topic covers impacts related to corruption and an organization’s approach related to contract and ownership transparency.  

Corruption in the oil and gas sector can occur throughout the value chain and has been linked to various negative impacts, such as misallocation of resources revenues, damage to the environment, abuse of democracy and human rights, and political instability. Corruption can lead to diversion of public revenues to private beneficiaries, at the expense of, for example, investments in infrastructure or services. This can be particularly critical in countries with high poverty levels, leading to increased inequalities and conflicts over oil and gas resources (see topic 11.18 Conflict and security).  

The oil and gas sector faces higher risks of corruption in comparison with other sectors. Characteristics of the sector that contribute to the potential for corruption include frequent interaction between oil and gas organizations and politically exposed persons   , such as government officials for licenses and other regulatory approvals. Other relevant sector characteristics include the complex financial transactions and the international reach of the sector.  

State-owned enterprises (SOEs) face specific challenges in relation to corruption because they may have less effective internal controls and be subject to partial independent oversight. In addition to driving profit, SOEs may also pursue broader objectives such as community development. However, without adequate oversight, measures for community development may be abused for corrupt purposes. Organizations in the oil and gas sector partnering with SOEs in joint ventures may face additional risks related to corruption as a result of this business relationship.  

Cases of corruption during bidding processes for exploration and production licenses have been documented in the oil and gas sector. Organizations in the sector have used corrupt practices to obtain confidential information, influence decision-making, and avoid environmental or other requirements. Such cases may result in licenses being awarded to less qualified organizations, jeopardize public investments, or negatively impact the environment and local communities. Opaque licensing procedures may also obstruct public scrutiny of oil and gas investments and transactions that could result in reduced public revenue.  

In other cases, corrupt practices have aimed to block or shape policies and regulations or to influence their enforcement. This might include regulations concerning land and resource rights, taxes and other government levies, or environmental protection.  

Across the value chain, a lack of transparency in procurement procedures in the oil and gas sector can also create a risk of corruption or fraud. Examples of this can include paying bribes to get regulations or quality requirements waived, receiving kickbacks for securing contracts at inflated prices, or profiting from inflated prices charged by an entity established as a front organization.  

To combat corruption and prevent the negative impacts that stem from it, organizations in the oil and gas sector are expected by the marketplace, international norms, and stakeholders to demonstrate their adherence to integrity, governance, and responsible business practices  

# Box 7. Transparency about contracts and ownership structures  

Publication of government contracts is a growing practice. It is endorsed by organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Bar Association, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  

Contracts governing the extraction of oil and gas resources are commonly devised by organizations in the sector and governments on behalf of citizens or local communities without public oversight. Fair terms for sharing risks and rewarding benefits, including those related to a just transition, are particularly relevant because of the long-term time horizons and widespread impacts of projects. Contract transparency helps local communities hold governments and organizations accountable for their negotiated terms and obligations. It also reduces information asymmetries between governments and oil and gas organizations and helps level the playing field in negotiations.  

Lack of transparency about ownership structures can make it difficult to determine who benefits from financial transactions in the oil and gas sector. Beneficial ownership transparency has been identified as a significant opportunity to deter conflicts of interest, corruption, and tax avoidance and evasion.

# Topic 11.21 Payments to governments  

Lack of transparency about payments to governments can contribute to inefficient management of public funds, illicit financial flows, and corruption. This topic covers impacts from an organization's practices related to payments to governments and the organization’s approach to transparency of such payments.  

Organizations in the oil and gas sector deal with a large number of complex financial transactions and make a variety of payments to governments. These include commodity trading revenues, exploration and production licensing fees, taxes and royalties, signature, discovery and production bonuses.  

Transparency of payments to governments can help distinguish the economic importance of the oil and gas sector to countries, enable public debate, and inform government decision-making. It can also provide insights into the terms of contracts, increase government accountability and strengthen revenue collection and management. Insufficient transparency of these payments, on the other hand, can impede detection of misallocation of revenues and corruption.  

Taxes, royalties, and other payments from organizations in the oil and gas sector are an important source of investment and revenue for local communities, countries, and regions (see topic 11.14 Economic impacts). However, aggressive tax practices or tax non-compliance can lead to diminished tax revenues in countries where the organizations operate. This can be particularly damaging for developing countries that may lack or have high needs for public revenue. The sector also receives substantial subsidies from governments in many countries, which are of great interest to stakeholders, such as investors or civil society.  

When disclosing information on payments to governments, organizations in the oil and gas sector often report aggregate payments at an organizational level. However, this can provide limited insight into payments made in each country or related to a project. Reporting country-level and project-level payments enables comparison of the payments made to those stipulated in fiscal, legal, and contractual terms, as well as to assess the financial contribution of oil and gas activities to host countries and communities. It can also enable governments to address tax avoidance and evasion, correct information asymmetry and level the playing field for governments when negotiating contracts.  

# Box 8. State-owned enterprises  

A state-owned enterprise (SOE) is, according to the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), ‘a wholly or majority government-owned company that is engaged in extractive activities on behalf of the government’ (see reference [386] in the Bibliography). SOEs often have special status, which can involve financial advantages and preferential treatment.  

SOEs often sell shares of the produced resource to buyers, including commodity trading companies. This first trade    is an important revenue stream for countries and can involve a high volume of financial transactions. However, data on these transactions is often scarce or inaccessible. The first trade can be subject to trade mispricing in the form of under-invoicing of exports or over-invoicing of imports to obtain financial gain. Other risks may result from selecting buyers and allocation of sales contracts (which can involve bribery and conflicts of interest) and moving income to a state treasury, potentially causing misallocation of revenues or generating public mistrust of revenue management (see also topic 11.20 Anti-corruption).  

Transparency in the operations and objectives of SOEs is crucial for monitoring their performance and maximizing their economic and social contributions.

17  This additional sector recommendation is based on Requirement 2.6 State participation in the EITI Standard 2019 [387]. 18  This additional sector recommendation is based on Requirement 4.1 Comprehensive disclosure of taxes and revenues and Requirement 4.7. Level of disaggregation in the EITI Standard 2019. A definition for project can be found in the EITI Standard 2019 [387]. 19  The EITI Standard 2019 specifies that in countries implementing the EITI, the multi-stakeholder group for the country agree which payments and revenues are material, including appropriate thresholds [387]. The organization can use the relevant threshold set by the EITI multi-stakeholder group. If there is no relevant threshold set, the organization can use a threshold equivalent to that established for the European Union, which specifies that ‘Payments, whether a single payment or a series of related payments, below EUR 100,000 within the reporting period can be excluded’ [380]. 20  This additional sector disclosure is based on Requirement 4.2 Sale of the state’s share of production or other revenues collected in kind in the EITI Standard 2019 [387] and EITI Reporting Guidelines for companies buying oil, gas and minerals from governments [385].

# Topic 11.22 Public policy  

An organization can participate in public policy development, directly or through an intermediary organization, by means of lobbying or making financial or in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians, or causes. While an organization can encourage the development of public policy that benefits society, participation can also be associated with corruption, bribery, undue influence or an imbalanced representation of the organization’s interests. This topic covers an organization’s approach to public policy advocacy, and the impacts that can result from the influence an organization exerts.  

The oil and gas sector can exert significant influence on government policies and is among the sectors with the largest lobbying expenditure. Documented cases have shown that lobbying by the oil and gas sector can obstruct progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals, or lead to policy and regulation inconsistent with the transition to a low-carbon economy. In regions where oil and gas generate significant revenue for governments, organizations in the sector may get better access to, and representation in meetings with, government representatives, which may lead to increased influence over public policy decisions. Organizations in the sector have made donations to political parties whose policies favor corporate agendas or gain special access to politicians.  

Advocacy and lobbying by the oil and gas sector have contributed to hindering environmental policies; blocking or amending legislation on environmental and social assessments of projects or fair participation of all stakeholders; overturning restrictions on resource development; acquiring permits for pipelines; and lowering labor standards, corporate taxes, and resource royalties. These activities have also been used to gain or retain government subsidies, which can result in commodity prices that do not reflect the full environmental costs of oil and gas products.  

The oil and gas sector has actively advocated against ambitious climate policies as well as for ensuring continued subsidies to the sector, through individual organizations in the sector and industry bodies. These activities have often been targeted against enforcing meaningful carbon pricing, carbon budgets, or other measures to reduce GHG emissions that could leave oil and gas assets and resources stranded. Sometimes, efforts have contradicted publicly stated corporate strategies and positions that support policies addressing climate change. Excessive subsidies for the sector can impede the transition to a low-carbon economy, and consequently hinder sustainable development, in numerous ways, including by reducing or inefficiently allocating available national resources, increasing dependence on fossil fuels, and discouraging investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency (see topic 11.2 Climate adaptation, resilience, and transition).

Definitions that are based on or come from the ISO 14046:2014 and ISO 45001:2018 standards are reproduced with the permission of the International Organization for Standardization, ISO. Copyright remains with ISO.  

Note: Hazards can be:  

physical (e.g., radiation, temperature extremes, constant loud noise, spills on floors or tripping hazards, unguarded machinery, faulty electrical equipment); ergonomic (e.g., improperly adjusted workstations and chairs, awkward   
movements, vibration);   
chemical (e.g., exposure to solvents, carbon monoxide, flammable materials, or pesticides);   
biological (e.g., exposure to blood and bodily fluids, fungi, bacteria, viruses, or insect bites);   
psychosocial (e.g., verbal abuse, harassment, bullying);   
related to work-organization (e.g., excessive workload demands, shift work, long hours, night work, workplace violence).  

# work-related injury or ill health  

negative impacts on health arising from exposure to hazards at work  

Source: International Labour Organization (ILO), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, ILO-OSH 2001, 2001; modified  

Note 1:  

‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and disorders. The terms ‘disease’, ‘illness’, and ‘disorder’ are often used interchangeably and refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses  

Note 2: Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at work. Other types of incident can occur that are not connected with the work itself. For example, the following incidents are not considered to be work related:  

a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that is unconnected with work; a worker driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (where driving is not part of the work, and where the transport has not been organized by the employer); a worker with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is unconnected with work.  

# Note 3:  

Traveling for work: Injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is traveling are work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work activities ‘in the interest of the employer’. Examples of such activities include traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer).  

Working at home: Injuries and ill health that occur when working at home are work related if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work at home, and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than the general home environment or setting.  

Mental illness: A mental illness is considered to be work related if it has been notified voluntarily by the worker and is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience stating that the illness is work related.  

For more guidance on determining ‘work-relatedness’, see the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Determination of work-relatedness 1904.5, https://www.osha.gov/pls/ oshaweb/owadisp.show_document? p_table $\O=$ STANDARDS&p_id $=9636$ , accessed on 1 June 2018.

# Introduction  

GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their economic performance-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its economic performance-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains four disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s economic performancerelated impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of economic performance. This includes the economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) by an organization, its defined benefit plan obligations, the financial assistance it receives from any government, and the financial implications of climate change.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its economic performance-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined economic performance to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s economic performance-related impacts (Disclosure 201-1 through Disclosure 201-4).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined economic performance to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for example:  

the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS are referenced for some of the disclosures);   
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC);   
national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.  

# Disclosure 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Direct economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) on an accruals basis, including the basic components for the organization’s global operations as listed below. If data are presented on a cash basis, report the justification for this decision in addition to reporting the following basic components:  

i. Direct economic value generated: revenues;   
ii. Economic value distributed: operating costs, employee wages and benefits, payments to providers of capital, payments to government by country, and community investments;   
iii. Economic value retained: ‘direct economic value generated’ less ‘economic value distributed’.  

b. Where significant, report EVG&D separately at country, regional, or market levels, and the criteria used for defining significance.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-1, the reporting organization shall, if applicable, compile the EVG&D from data in the organization’s audited financial or profit and loss (P&L) statement, or its internally audited management accounts.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Information on the creation and distribution of economic value provides a basic indication of how an organization has created wealth for stakeholders. Several components of the economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) also provide an economic profile of an organization, which can be useful for normalizing other performance figures.  

If presented in country-level detail, EVG&D can provide a useful picture of the direct monetary value added to local economies.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 201-1  

Revenues  

An organization can calculate revenues as net sales plus revenues from financial investments and sales of assets.  

Net sales can be calculated as gross sales from products and services minus returns, discounts, and allowances.  

Revenues from financial investments can include cash received as:  

interest on financial loans;   
dividends from shareholdings;   
royalties;  

direct income generated from assets, such as property rental.  

Revenues from sale of assets can include:  

physical assets, such as property, infrastructure, and equipment; • intangibles, such as intellectual property rights, designs, and brand names.  

Operating costs  

An organization can calculate operating costs as cash payments made outside the organization for materials, product components, facilities, and services purchased.  

Services purchased can include payments to self-employed persons, temporary placement agencies and other organizations providing services. Costs related to workers who are not employees working in an operational role are included as part of services purchased, rather than under employee wages and benefits.  

Operating costs can include:  

property rental;   
license fees;   
facilitation payments (since these have a clear commercial objective);   
royalties;   
payments for contract workers;   
training costs, if outside trainers are used;   
personal protective clothing.  

The use of facilitation payments is also addressed in GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016.  

Employee wages and benefits  

An organization can calculate employee wages and benefits as total payroll (including employee salaries and amounts paid to government institutions on behalf of employees) plus total benefits (excluding training, costs of protective equipment or other cost items directly related to the employee’s job function).  

Amounts paid to government institutions on behalf of employees can include employee taxes, levies, and unemployment funds.  

Total benefits can include:  

• regular contributions, such as to pensions, insurance, company vehicles, and private health; other employee support, such as housing, interest-free loans, public transport assistance, educational grants, and redundancy payments.  

Payments to providers of capital  

An organization can calculate payments to providers of capital as dividends to all shareholders, plus interest payments made to providers of loans.  

Interest payments made to providers of loans can include:  

interest on all forms of debt and borrowings (not only long-term debt);   
arrears of dividends due to preferred shareholders.  

Payments to government  

An organization can calculate payments to governments as all of the organization’s taxes plus related penalties paid at the international, national, and local levels. Organization taxes can include corporate, income, and property.  

Payments to government exclude deferred taxes, because they may not be paid.  

If operating in more than one country, the organization can report taxes paid by country, including the definition of segmentation used.  

# Community investments  

Total community investments refers to actual expenditures in the reporting period, not commitments. An organization can calculate community investments as voluntary donations plus investment of funds in the broader community where the target beneficiaries are external to the organization. Voluntary donations and investment of funds in the broader community where the target beneficiaries are external to the organization can include:  

contributions to charities, NGOs and research institutes (unrelated to the organization’s commercial research and development); funds to support community infrastructure, such as recreational facilities; direct costs of social programs, including arts and educational events.  

If reporting infrastructure investments, an organization can include costs of goods and labor, in addition to capital costs, as well as operating costs for support of ongoing facilities or programs. An example of support for ongoing facilities or programs can include the organization funding the daily operations of a public facility.  

Community investments exclude legal and commercial activities or where the purpose of the investment is exclusively commercial (donations to political parties can be included, but are also addressed separately in more detail in GRI 415: Public Policy 2016).  

Community investments also exclude any infrastructure investment that is driven primarily by core business needs, or to facilitate the business operations of an organization. Infrastructure investments driven primarily by core business needs can include, for example, building a road to a mine or a factory. The calculation of investment can include infrastructure built outside the main business activities of the organization, such as a school or hospital for workers and their families.

# Disclosure 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Risks and opportunities posed by climate change that have the potential to generate substantive changes in operations, revenue, or expenditure, including:  

i. a description of the risk or opportunity and its classification as either physical, regulatory, or other;   
ii. a description of the impact associated with the risk or opportunity;   
iii. the financial implications of the risk or opportunity before action is taken;   
iv. the methods used to manage the risk or opportunity;   
v. the costs of actions taken to manage the risk or opportunity.  

Compilation requirements  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-2, if the reporting organization does not have a system in place to calculate the financial implications or costs, or to make revenue projections, it shall report its plans and timeline to develop the necessary systems.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-2, the reporting organization should report the following additional characteristics for the identified risks and opportunities:  

2.3.1 A description of the risk or opportunity driver, such as a particular piece of legislation, or a physical driver, such as water scarcity;   
2.3.2 The projected time frame in which the risk or opportunity is expected to have substantive financial implications;   
2.3.3 Direct and indirect impacts (whether the impact directly affects the organization, or indirectly affects the organization via its supply chain or entities downstream from it);   
2.3.4 The potential impacts generally, including increased or decreased: 2.3.4.1 capital and operational costs; 2.3.4.2 demand for products and services; 2.3.4.3 capital availability and investment opportunities;   
2.3.5 Likelihood (the probability of the impact on the organization);   
2.3.6 Magnitude of impact (if occurring, the extent to which the impact affects the organization financially).  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 201-2  

Risk and opportunities due to climate change can be classified as:  

physical • regulatory • other  

Physical risks and opportunities can include:  

the impact of more frequent and intense storms;   
changes in sea level, ambient temperature, and water availability;   
impacts on workers – such as health effects, including heat-related illness or disease, and the need to relocate operations.  

Other risks and opportunities can include the availability of new technologies, products, or services to address challenges related to climate change, as well as changes in customer behavior.  

Methods used to manage the risk or opportunity can include:  

carbon capture and storage;   
fuel switching;   
use of renewable and lower carbon footprint energy; improving energy efficiency;   
flaring, venting, and fugitive emission reduction;   
renewable energy certificates;   
use of carbon offsets.  

# Background  

Climate change presents risks and opportunities to organizations, their investors, and their other stakeholders.  

As governments move to regulate activities that contribute to climate change, organizations that are directly or indirectly responsible for emissions face regulatory risks and opportunities. Risks can include increased costs or other factors impacting competitiveness. However, limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can also create opportunities for organizations as new technologies and markets are created. This is especially the case for organizations that can use or produce energy and energy-efficient products more effectively.  

See references [2], [3] and [4] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. If the plan’s liabilities are met by the organization’s general resources, the estimated value of those liabilities. If a separate fund exists to pay the plan’s pension liabilities: i. the extent to which the scheme’s liabilities are estimated to be covered by the assets that have been set aside to meet them; ii. the basis on which that estimate has been arrived at; iii. when that estimate was made.   
c. If a fund set up to pay the plan’s pension liabilities is not fully covered, explain the strategy, if any, adopted by the employer to work towards full coverage, and the timescale, if any, by which the employer hopes to achieve full coverage.   
d. Percentage of salary contributed by employee or employer.   
e. Level of participation in retirement plans, such as participation in mandatory or voluntary schemes, regional, or country-based schemes, or those with financial impact.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.4 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-3, the reporting organization should:  

2.4.1 calculate the information in accordance with the regulations and methods for relevant jurisdictions, and report aggregated totals;   
2.4.2 use the same consolidation techniques as those applied in preparing the financial accounts of the organization.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 201-3  

The structure of retirement plans offered to employees can be based on:  

defined benefit plans;   
defined contribution plans;   
other types of retirement benefits.  

Different jurisdictions, such as countries, have varying interpretations and guidance regarding calculations used to determine plan coverage.  

Note that benefit pension plans are part of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) IAS 19 Employee Benefits, however IAS 19 covers additional topics.  

See reference [7] in the Bibliography.  

# Background  

When an organization provides a retirement plan for its employees, these benefits can become a commitment that members of the schemes plan on for their long-term economic well-being.  

Defined benefit plans have potential implications for employers in terms of the obligations that need to be met. Other types of plans, such as defined contribution plans, do not guarantee access to a retirement plan or the quality of the benefits. Thus, the type of plan chosen has implications for both employees and employers. Conversely, a properly funded pension plan can help to attract and maintain employees and support long-term financial and strategic planning on the part of the employer.  

# Disclosure 201-4 Financial assistance received from government  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total monetary value of financial assistance received by the organization from any government during the reporting period, including:  

i. tax relief and tax credits;   
ii. subsidies;   
iii. investment grants, research and development grants, and other relevant types of grant;   
iv. awards;   
v. royalty holidays;   
vi. financial assistance from Export Credit Agencies (ECAs);   
vii. financial incentives;   
viii. other financial benefits received or receivable from any government for any operation.  

b. The information in 201-4-a by country.  

c. Whether, and the extent to which, any government is present in the shareholding structure.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.5 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-4, the reporting organization shall identify the monetary value of financial assistance received from government through consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure provides a measure of governments’ contributions to an organization.  

The significant financial assistance received from a government, in comparison with taxes paid, can be useful for developing a balanced picture of the transactions between the organization and government.  

See reference [8] in the Bibliography.

# Introduction  

GRI 202: Market Presence 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their market presence-related impacts and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its market presence-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s market presence-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of an organization’s market presence, covering its contribution to economic development in the local areas or communities where it operates. For example, this can include the organization’s approaches to remuneration or local hiring.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its market presence-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined market presence to be a material topic:  

• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s market presence-related impacts (Disclosure 202-1 through Disclosure 202-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined market presence to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages market presence using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for example:  

the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS are referenced for some of the disclosures);   
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC);   
national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.  

# Disclosure 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. When a significant proportion of employees are compensated based on wages subject to minimum wage rules, report the relevant ratio of the entry level wage by gender at significant locations of operation to the minimum wage.   
b. When a significant proportion of other workers (excluding employees) performing the organization’s activities are compensated based on wages subject to minimum wage rules, describe the actions taken to determine whether these workers are paid above the minimum wage.   
c. Whether a local minimum wage is absent or variable at significant locations of operation, by gender. In circumstances in which different minimums can be used as a reference, report which minimum wage is being used.   
d. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 202-1-b, the reporting organization should:  

2.1.1 use the data from Disclosure 2-8 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization;   
2.1.2 if applicable, convert the entry level wage to the same units used in the minimum wage (e.g., hourly or monthly basis);   
2.1.3 when a significant proportion of other workers (excluding employees) performing the organization’s activities are compensated based on wages subject to minimum wage rules, report the relevant ratio of the entry level wage by gender at significant locations of operation to the minimum wage.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure applies to those organizations in which a substantial portion of their employees, and workers (excluding employees) performing the organization’s activities, are compensated in a manner or scale that is closely linked to laws or regulations on minimum wage.  

Providing wages above the minimum wage can help contribute to the economic well-being of workers performing the organization’s activities. The impacts of wage levels are immediate, and they directly affect individuals, organizations, countries and economies. The distribution of wages is crucial for eliminating inequalities, such as wage gap differences between women and men, or nationals and migrants.  

Also, entry level wages paid compared to local minimum wages show the competitiveness of an organization’s wages and provide information relevant for assessing the effect of wages on the local labor market. Comparing this information by gender can also be a measure of an organization’s approach to equal opportunity in the workplace.  

# Disclosure 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of senior management at significant locations of operation that are hired from the local community.   
b. The definition used for ‘senior management’.   
c. The organization’s geographical definition of ‘local’.   
d. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.  

# GUIDANCE  

Compilation requirements  

# 2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 202-2, the reporting organization shall calculate this percentage using data on full-time employees.  

Senior management hired from the local community includes those individuals either born or who have the legal right to reside indefinitely (such as naturalized citizens or permanent visa holders) in the same geographic market as the operation. The geographical definition of ‘local’ can include the community surrounding operations, a region within a country, or a country.  

# Background  

Including members from the local community in an organization’s senior management demonstrates the organization’s positive market presence. Including local community members in the management team can enhance human capital. It can also increase the economic benefit to the local community, and improve an organization’s ability to understand local needs.

# Introduction  

GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their indirect economic impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its indirect economic impacts.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s indirect economic impacts. The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses an organization’s indirect economic impacts, including impacts of an organization’s infrastructure investments and services supported.  

An economic impact can be defined as a change in the productive potential of the economy that has an influence on a community’s or stakeholder’s well-being and longer-term prospects for development. Indirect economic impacts  are the additional consequences of the direct impact of financial transactions and the flow of money between an organization and its stakeholders.  

Indirect economic impacts can be monetary or non-monetary, and are particularly important to assess in relation to local communities and regional economies.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/9afd614613a2a1dc8fe33178d433ebdec8f3cf4f0fc2830a47c59234251c0d67.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its indirect economic impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined indirect economic impacts to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s indirect economic impacts (Disclosure 203-1 through Disclosure 203-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined indirect economic performance to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages indirect economic impacts using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.2 The reporting organization should:  

1.2.1 describe work undertaken to understand indirect economic impacts at the national, regional, or local level;   
1.2.2 explain whether it conducted a community needs assessment to determine the need for infrastructure and other services, and describe the results of the assessment.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for example:  

the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS are referenced for some of the disclosures);   
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC);   
national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.  

# Disclosure 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Extent of development of significant  infrastructure investments and services supported.   
b. Current or expected impacts on communities and local economies, including positive and negative impacts where relevant.   
c. Whether these investments and services are commercial, in-kind, or pro bono engagements.   
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 203-1, the reporting organization should disclose: 2.1.1 the size, cost and duration of each significant infrastructure investment or service supported; 2.1.2 the extent to which different communities or local economies are impacted by the organization’s infrastructure investments and services supported.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure concerns the impact that an organization’s infrastructure investments and services supported have on its stakeholders and the economy.  

The impacts of infrastructure investment can extend beyond the scope of an organization’s own operations and over a longer timescale. Such investments can include transport links, utilities, community social facilities, health and welfare centers, and sports centers. Along with investment in its own operations, this is one measure of the organization’s capital contribution to the economy.  

# Disclosure 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Examples of significant identified indirect economic impacts of the organization, including positive and negative impacts.   
b. Significance of the indirect economic impacts in the context of external benchmarks and stakeholder priorities, such as national and international standards, protocols, and policy agendas.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 203-2  

This disclosure concerns the spectrum of indirect economic impacts that an organization can have on its stakeholders and the economy.  

Examples of significant indirect economic impacts, both positive and negative, can include:  

changes in the productivity of organizations, sectors, or the whole economy (such as through greater adoption of information technology);   
economic development in areas of high poverty (such as changes in the total number of dependents supported through the income of a single job);   
economic impacts of improving or deteriorating social or environmental conditions (such as changing job market in an area converted from small farms to large plantations, or the economic impacts of pollution);   
availability of products and services for those on low incomes (such as preferential pricing of pharmaceuticals, which contributes to a healthier population that can participate more fully in the economy; or pricing structures that exceed the economic capacity of those on low incomes);   
enhanced skills and knowledge in a professional community or in a geographic location (such as when shifts in an organization’s needs attract additional skilled workers to an area, who, in turn, drive a local need for new learning institutions);   
number of jobs supported in the supply or distribution chain (such as the employment impacts on suppliers as a result of an organization’s growth or contraction);   
stimulating, enabling, or limiting foreign direct investment (such as when an organization changes the infrastructure or services it provides in a developing country, which then leads to changes in foreign direct investment in the region);   
economic impacts from a change in operation or activity location (such as the impact of outsourcing jobs to an overseas location);   
economic impacts from the use of products and services (such as economic growth resulting from the use of a particular product or service).  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined.

# Introduction  

GRI 204: Procurement Practices 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their procurement practice-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its procurement practice-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s procurement practicerelated impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of procurement practices. This covers an organization’s support for local suppliers or those owned by women or members of vulnerable groups. It also covers how the organization’s procurement practices (such as the lead times it gives to suppliers, or the purchasing prices it negotiates) cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/d3d5d01dd029e1a7d29146061b912e8309236324a6ce43bbd4f5a16bf43b9803.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its procurement practice-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined procurement practices to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s procurement practice-related impacts (Disclosure 204-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined procurement practices to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages procurement practices using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also:  

describe actions taken to identify and adjust the organization’s procurement practices that cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain, including:   
how dialogue with suppliers is used to identify procurement practices that cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain;   
- actions taken to adjust payment policies and procedures;   
describe policies and practices used to select locally-based suppliers, either organizationwide or for specific locations;   
explain the rationale and methodology for tracing the source, origin, or production conditions of raw materials and production inputs purchased, if applicable;   
describe policies and practices used to promote economic inclusion when selecting suppliers.  

Procurement practices that cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain can include:  

stability or length of relationships with suppliers;   
lead times;   
ordering and payment routines;   
purchasing prices;   
changing or cancelling orders.  

Forms of economic inclusion can include:  

small and medium-sized suppliers;   
suppliers owned by women;   
suppliers which are owned by or recruit workers from members of vulnerable, marginalized, or under-represented social groups.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for example:  

the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS are referenced for some of the disclosures);   
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC);   
national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of the procurement budget used for significant locations of operation that is spent on suppliers local to that operation (such as percentage of products and services purchased locally).   
b. The organization’s geographical definition of ‘local’.   
c. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.   
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 204-1, the reporting organization should calculate the percentages based on invoices or commitments made during the reporting period, e.g, using accruals accounting.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 204-1  

Local purchases can be made either from a budget managed at the location of operation or at an organization’s headquarters.  

# Background  

By supporting local suppliers, an organization can indirectly attract additional investment to the local economy. Local sourcing can be a strategy to help ensure supply, support a stable local economy, and maintain community relations.

# Introduction  

GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their corruptionrelated impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its corruptionrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s corruption-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of anti-corruption. In this Standard, corruption is understood to include practices such as bribery, facilitation payments, fraud, extortion, collusion, and money laundering; the offer or receipt of gifts, loans, fees, rewards, or other advantages as an inducement to do something that is dishonest, illegal, or represents a breach of trust. It can also include practices such as embezzlement, trading in influence, abuse of function, illicit enrichment, concealment, and obstructing justice.  

Corruption is broadly linked to negative impacts, such as poverty in transition economies, damage to the environment, abuse of human rights, abuse of democracy, misallocation of investments, and undermining the rule of law. Organizations are expected by the marketplace, international norms, and stakeholders to demonstrate their adherence to integrity, governance, and responsible business practices.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its corruption-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined anti-corruption to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s corruption-related impacts (Disclosure 205-1 through Disclosure 205-3).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined anti-corruption to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages anti-corruption using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

The reporting organization should disclose the following information:  

1.2.1 The organization’s risk assessment procedures for corruption, including the criteria used in the risk assessment, such as location, activity, and sector;   
1.2.2 How the organization identifies and manages have conflicts of interest that employees or persons linked to the organization’s activities, products, or services may Conflicts of interest for the highest governance body are covered in Disclosure 2-15 of GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021;   
1.2.3 How the organization ensures that charitable donations and sponsorships (financial and in-kind) that are made to other organizations are not used as a disguised form of bribery. Recipients of charitable donations and sponsorships (financial and in-kind) can include not-for-profit organizations, religious organizations, private organizations, and events;   
1.2.4 The extent to which communication and training on anti-corruption is tailored to those governance body members, employees, business partners, and other persons that have been identified as having a high risk of incidents of corruption;   
1.2.5 At which stage the training on anti-corruption for governance body members, employees, business partners and other persons that have been identified as having a high risk of incidents of corruption is provided (e.g., when new employees join the organization or when relationships with new business partners are established); and the frequency of the training (e.g., annually or biannually);   
1.2.6 Whether the organization participates in collective action to combat corruption, including: 1.2.6.1 the strategy for the collective action activities; 1.2.6.2 a list of the collective action initiatives in which the organization participates; 1.2.6.3 a description of the main commitments of these initiatives.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for clauses 1.2.4 and 1.2.5  

In the context of this GRI Standard, the term ‘business partners’ includes, among others, suppliers, agents, lobbyists and other intermediaries, joint venture and consortia partners, governments, customers, and clients.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

# GUIDANCE  

a. Total number and percentage of operations assessed for risks related to corruption b. Significant risks related to corruption identified through the risk assessment.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 205-1  

This disclosure can include a risk assessment focused on corruption or the inclusion of corruption as a risk factor in overall risk assessments.  

The term ‘operation’ refers to a single location used by the organization for the production, storage and/or distribution of its goods and services, or for administrative purposes. Within a single operation, there can be multiple production lines, warehouses, or other activities. For example, a single factory can be used for multiple products or a single retail outlet can contain several different retail operations that are owned or managed by the organization.  

# Background  

This disclosure measures the extent of the risk assessment’s implementation across an organization. Risk assessments can help to assess the potential for incidents of corruption within and related to the organization, and help the organization to design policies and procedures to combat corruption.  

# Disclosure 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number and percentage of governance body members that the organization’s anticorruption policies and procedures have been communicated to, broken down by region.

# Introduction  

GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behavior 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their anticompetitive behavior-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its anticompetitive behavior-related impact.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s anti-competitive behaviorrelated impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of anti-competitive behavior, including anti-trust and monopoly practices.  

Anti-competitive behavior refers to actions of an organization or its employees that can result in collusion with potential competitors, with the purpose of limiting the effects of market competition. This can include fixing prices or coordinating bids, creating market or output restrictions, imposing geographic quotas, and allocating customers, suppliers, geographic areas, or product lines.  

Anti-trust and monopoly practices are actions of an organization that can result in collusion to erect barriers for entry to the sector, or to otherwise prevent competition. This can include unfair business practices, abuse of market position, cartels, anti-competitive mergers, and price-fixing.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/a8f42a34ea9760c099d82b7d15a3d3905d52780395cae9000e81dfb3b15882b3.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its anti-competitive behavior-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined anti-competitive behavior to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s anti-competitive behavior-related impacts (Disclosure 206-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined anti-competitive behavior to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages anti-competitive behavior using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Number of legal actions pending or completed during the reporting period regarding anti-competitive behavior and violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation in which the organization has been identified as a participant.   
b. Main outcomes of completed legal actions, including any decisions or judgements.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure pertains to legal actions initiated under national or international laws designed primarily for the purpose of regulating anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, or monopoly practices.  

Anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices can affect consumer choice, pricing, and other factors that are essential to efficient markets. Legislation introduced in many countries seeks to control or prevent monopolies, with the underlying assumption that competition between enterprises also promotes economic efficiency and sustainable growth.  

Legal action indicates a situation in which the market actions or status of an organization have reached a sufficient scale to merit concern by a third party. Legal decisions arising from these situations can carry the risk of significant disruption of market activities for the organization as well as punitive measures.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Introduction  

GRI 207: Tax 2019 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their tax-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on how it manages tax, and information about its revenue, tax, and business activities on a country-by-country basis.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains three disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its taxrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s tax-related impacts. The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of tax.  

Taxes are important sources of government revenue and are central to the fiscal policy and macroeconomic stability of countries.  

They are acknowledged by the United Nations to play a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.1 They are also a key mechanism by which organizations contribute to the economies of the countries in which they operate.  

Taxes paid by an organization reflect that profitability depends on many factors external to the organization, including access to workers, markets, public infrastructure and services, natural resources, and a public administration.  

Organizations have an obligation to comply with tax legislation, and a responsibility to their stakeholders to meet expectations of good tax practices. If organizations seek to minimize their tax obligation in a jurisdiction, they might deprive the government of revenue. This could lead to reduced investment in public infrastructure and services, increase in government debt, or shifting of the tax obligation onto other tax payers.  

Perceptions of tax avoidance by an organization could also undermine tax compliance more broadly, by driving other organizations to engage in aggressive tax planning based on the view that they might otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage. This can lead to increasing costs associated with tax regulation and enforcement.  

Public reporting on tax increases transparency and promotes trust and credibility in the tax practices of organizations and in the tax systems. It enables stakeholders to make informed judgments about an organization’s tax positions. Tax transparency also informs public debate and supports the development of socially desirable tax policy.  

# Country-by-country reporting  

Country-by-country reporting involves the reporting of financial, economic, and tax-related information for each jurisdiction in which an organization operates. This indicates the organization’s scale of activity and the contribution it makes through tax in these jurisdictions.  

In combination with the topic management disclosures, country-by-country reporting gives insight into the organization’s tax practices in different jurisdictions. It can also signal to stakeholders any potential reputational and financial risks in the organization’s tax practices.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its tax-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined tax to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s tax-related impacts (Disclosure 207-1 through Disclosure 207-4).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined tax to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 207-1 through Disclosure 207-3) that are relevant to its taxrelated impacts.  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# Disclosure 207-1 Approach to tax  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of the approach to tax, including:  

i. whether the organization has a tax strategy and, if so, a link to this strategy if publicly available;   
ii. the governance body or executive-level position within the organization that formally reviews and approves the tax strategy, and the frequency of this review;   
iii. the approach to regulatory compliance;   
iv. how the approach to tax is linked to the business and sustainable development strategies of the organization.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

An organization’s approach to tax defines how the organization balances tax compliance with business activities and ethical, societal, and sustainable development-related expectations. It can include the organization’s tax principles, its attitude to tax planning, the degree of risk the organization is willing to accept, and the organization’s approach to engaging with tax authorities.  

An organization’s approach to tax is often described in a tax strategy, but it could also be described in equivalent documents, such as policies, standards, principles, or codes of conduct.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a  

The reporting organization can illustrate its approach to tax by providing examples drawn from its tax practices. For example, the organization can provide an overview of its use of tax havens, the types of tax incentive it uses, or its approach to transfer pricing. These examples help demonstrate the organization’s risk appetite and the tax practices deemed acceptable and unacceptable by the organization and its highest governance body.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-i  

If the organization has a tax strategy but the strategy is not publicly available, the organization can provide an abstract or summary of the strategy.  

If the organization has a tax strategy that applies to a smaller number of entities or tax jurisdictions than reported in Disclosure 207-4, the organization may report this strategy and list the entities or tax jurisdictions to which the strategy applies.  

In addition to the overall strategy, if the organization has tax strategies that apply to individual entities or tax jurisdictions, the organization can explain any relevant differences between these strategies.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iii  

When describing its approach to regulatory compliance, the organization can describe any statements in its tax strategy or equivalent documents regarding its intention with respect to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. For example, the organization can describe whether it seeks to comply with the letter and the spirit of the law. That is, whether the organization takes reasonable steps to determine and follow the intention of the legislature.2  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iv  

When describing how its approach to tax is linked to its business strategy, the organization can explain how its tax planning is aligned with its commercial activities. The description can include any relevant statements from its tax strategy or equivalent documents.  

When describing how its approach to tax is linked to its sustainable development strategy, the organization can explain the following:  

Whether it considered the economic and social impacts of its approach to tax when developing its tax strategy. Any organizational commitments to sustainable development in the jurisdictions in which it operates and whether its approach to tax is aligned with these commitments.  

# Disclosure 207-2 Tax governance, control, and risk management  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of the tax governance and control framework, including:  

i. the governance body or executive-level position within the organization accountable for compliance with the tax strategy; ii. how the approach to tax is embedded within the organization; iii. the approach to tax risks, including how risks are identified, managed, and monitored; iv. how compliance with the tax governance and control framework is evaluated.   
b. A description of the mechanisms to raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct and the organization’s integrity in relation to tax.   
c. A description of the assurance process for disclosures on tax including, if applicable, a link or reference to the external assurance report(s) or assurance statement(s).  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Having robust governance, control, and risk management systems in place for tax can be an indication that the reported approach to tax and tax strategy are well embedded in an organization and that the organization is effectively monitoring its compliance obligations. Reporting this information reassures stakeholders that the organization’s practices reflect the statements it has made about its approach to tax in its tax strategy or equivalent documents.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a  

When describing the tax governance and control framework, the reporting organization can provide examples of effective implementation of its tax governance, control, and risk management systems.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-i  

If the highest governance body in an organization is accountable for compliance with the tax strategy, the organization can specify the degree to which the highest governance body has oversight of compliance. The organization can also specify any accountability for compliance delegated to executive-level positions within the organization.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-ii  

When reporting how the approach to tax is embedded within the organization, the organization can describe processes, projects, programs, and initiatives that support adherence to the approach to tax and tax strategy.  

Examples of such initiatives can include:  

training and guidance provided to relevant employees on the link between tax strategy, business strategy, and sustainable development;   
remuneration or incentive schemes for the person(s) responsible for implementing the tax strategy;   
succession-planning for positions within the organization that are responsible for tax; participation in tax transparency initiatives or representative associations that seek to develop best practice around disclosures on tax or educate stakeholders on tax-related issues.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iii  

Tax risks are risks associated with the organization’s tax practices that might lead to a negative effect on the goals of the organization, or to financial or reputational damage. These include compliance risks or risks such as those related to uncertain tax positions, changes in legislation, or a perception of aggressive tax practices.  

When reporting on the approach to tax risks, the organization can describe its risk appetite and tolerance and provide examples of tax practices it has avoided because they are misaligned with its approach to tax and tax strategy. Risk appetite and tolerance indicate the degree of risk the organization is willing to accept in determining its tax positions.  

When reporting how tax risks are identified, managed, and monitored, the organization can:  

describe the role of the highest governance body in the tax risk management process;   
describe how the tax risk management process is communicated and embedded across   
the organization;   
refer to any internal control frameworks or generally accepted risk management principles that are applied to tax.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iv  

When reporting how compliance with the tax governance and control framework is evaluated, the organization can describe the process through which the tax governance and control framework is monitored, tested, and maintained. An example of this is giving an internal auditor accountability for undertaking annual reviews of the tax department’s compliance with the tax governance and control framework.  

The organization can also specify the degree to which the highest governance body has oversight of the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the tax governance and control framework.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-b  

One example of a mechanism for individuals to raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct, or about activities that compromise the organization’s integrity in relation to tax, is whistleblowing.  

Disclosure 207-2-b is related to Disclosure 2-26 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the information reported by the organization in Disclosure 2-26 covers mechanisms used to raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct in relation to tax, the organization can provide a reference to this information.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-c  

Disclosure 207-2-c is related to Disclosure 2-5 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the assurance process for disclosures on tax has been completed as part of another assurance process, the organization can provide a reference to this information reported in Disclosure 2-5 or elsewhere.  

# Disclosure 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of the approach to stakeholder engagement and management of stakeholder concerns related to tax, including:  

i. the approach to engagement with tax authorities;   
ii. the approach to public policy advocacy on tax;   
iii. the processes for collecting and considering the views and concerns of stakeholders, including external stakeholders.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Organizations’ tax practices are of interest to various stakeholders. The approach an organization takes to engaging with stakeholders has the potential to influence its reputation and position of trust. This includes how the organization engages with tax authorities in the development of tax systems, legislation, and administration.  

Stakeholder engagement can enable the organization to understand evolving expectations related to tax. It can give the organization insight into potential future regulatory changes and enable the organization to better manage its risks and impacts.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-i  

The approach to engagement with tax authorities can include participating in cooperative compliance agreements, seeking active real-time audit, seeking clearance for all significant transactions, engaging on tax risks, and seeking advance pricing agreements.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-ii  

When reporting the approach to public policy advocacy on tax, the reporting organization can describe:  

its lobbying activities related to tax; its stance on significant issues related to tax that it addresses in its public policy advocacy, and any differences between its advocacy positions and its stated policies, goals, or other public positions; whether it is a member of, or contributes to, any representative associations or committees that participate in public policy advocacy on tax, including: the nature of this contribution; any differences between the organization’s stated policies, goals, or other public positions on significant issues related to tax, and the positions of the representative associations or committees.  

Disclosure 207-3-a-ii is related to the requirements in GRI 415: Public Policy 2016. If the organization has determined public policy to be a material topic and has reported information in GRI 415 that covers the organization’s public policy advocacy on tax, the organization can provide a reference to this information.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-iii  

When reporting the processes for collecting and considering the views and concerns of stakeholders, the organization can describe how the processes enable stakeholders to participate in this engagement. The organization can also provide examples of how stakeholder feedback has influenced the approach to tax, the tax strategy, or the tax practices of the organization.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 207-4 Country-by-country reporting  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. All tax jurisdictions where the entities included in the organization’s audited consolidated financial statements, or in the financial information filed on public record, are resident for tax purposes.   
b. For each tax jurisdiction reported in Disclosure 207-4-a: i. Names of the resident entities; ii. Primary activities of the organization; iii. Number of employees, and the basis of calculation of this number; iv. Revenues from third-party sales; v. Revenues from intra-group transactions with other tax jurisdictions; vi. Profit/loss before tax; vii. Tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents; viii. Corporate income tax paid on a cash basis; ix. Corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss; x. Reasons for the difference between corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss and the tax due if the statutory tax rate is applied to profit/loss before tax.  

c. The time period covered by the information reported in Disclosure 207-4.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 207-4, the reporting organization shall report information for the time period covered by the most recent audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record. If information is not available for this time period, the organization may report information for the time period covered by the audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public record, immediately preceding the most recent ones.  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 207-4-b, the reporting organization shall:  

2.2.1 reconcile the data reported for Disclosures 207-4-b-iv, vi, vii, and viii with the data stated in its audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public record, for the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c. Where the data reported does not reconcile with the audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public record, the organization shall provide an explanation for this difference;   
2.2.2 for Disclosure 207-4-b-ix, include corporate income tax accrued in the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c and exclude deferred corporate income tax and provisions for uncertain tax positions;   
2.2.3 in cases where an entity is deemed not to be resident in any tax jurisdiction, provide the information for this stateless entity separately.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

The reporting organization should report the following additional information for each tax jurisdiction reported in Disclosure 207-4-a:  

2.3.1 Total employee remuneration;   
2.3.2 Taxes withheld and paid on behalf of employees;   
2.3.3 Taxes collected from customers on behalf of a tax authority;   
2.3.4 Industry-related and other taxes or payments to governments;   
2.3.5 Significant uncertain tax positions;   
2.3.6 Balance of intra-company debt held by entities in the tax jurisdiction, and the   
basis of calculation of the interest rate paid on the debt.  

# Background  

Country-by-country reporting is the reporting of financial, economic, and tax-related information for each jurisdiction in which the organization operates.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-a  

In the context of this Standard, tax jurisdictions are identified according to where the entities included in the organization’s audited consolidated financial statements, or in the financial information filed on public record, are resident for tax purposes. These entities include permanent establishments and dormant entities.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b  

Unless otherwise stated, country-by-country information is to be reported at the level of tax jurisdictions and not at the level of individual entities.  

Number of employees, revenues, profit/loss before tax, and tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents are indicators of the organization’s scale of activity within a tax jurisdiction. When considered in conjunction with the other required and recommended information, they can inform assessments about the level of taxes being paid in a jurisdiction.  

In addition to this information, the organization can report any other information relevant for understanding the scale of its activity within a jurisdiction.  

If the reporting organization cannot report all required information for all the tax jurisdictions reported in Disclosure 207-4-a, it may use reasons for omission as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. The organization is required to specify the requirement it cannot comply with, and to provide a reason for omission and required explanation, as set out in GRI 1. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If complete reporting for a tax jurisdiction is not possible because the organization holds a minority shareholding or is the non-operating joint venture partner in an entity, the organization may provide ‘information unavailable $/$ incomplete’ as the reason for omission and specify the majority shareholder or operating partner.  

The organization can also report any contextual information necessary to understand how data has been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-i  

Disclosure 207-4-b-i requires the organization to report a list of entities by tax jurisdiction.  

If the organization’s publicly available audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public record, include a list of all its entities by tax jurisdiction, the organization can provide a reference to this information.  

When reporting the names of the resident entities for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can specify if any of the entities are dormant.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-ii  

When reporting its primary activities in a tax jurisdiction, the organization can provide a general description such that a report reader can clearly identify the organization’s main activities in the jurisdiction, for example, sales, marketing, manufacturing, or distribution. The organization is not required to list the activities of each entity in the jurisdiction.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-iii  

Employee numbers can be reported using an appropriate calculation, such as head count at the end of the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c or a full-time equivalent (FTE) calculation. To enable comparability, it is important that the organization applies the approach consistently across all tax jurisdictions and between time periods.  

If the organization is unable to report exact figures, it can report the number of employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than 1000, to the nearest 100.  

The number of employees is one indicator of the organization’s scale of activity in a tax jurisdiction. In addition to the number of employees, the organization may report the number of workers (excluding employees) performing the organization’s activities, if this helps explain the organization’s scale of activity in the jurisdiction. It is important that the organization reports the number of employees and/or the number of workers consistently across all jurisdictions and between time periods.  

# Guidance for Disclosures 207-4-b-iv and 207-4-b-v  

These disclosures require the organization to report revenues from third-party sales for each tax jurisdiction and from intra-group transactions between that jurisdiction and other tax jurisdictions. Intra-group transactions within the same tax jurisdiction are not required, but the organization can report this information separately.  

Intra-group transactions between jurisdictions can influence the tax bases of the organization in the jurisdictions involved in these transactions. Intra-group transactions within the same tax jurisdiction do not affect the tax base of the organization within that jurisdiction.  

For this reason, revenues from third-party sales and intra-group transactions with other jurisdictions are a more appropriate indicator of an organization’s scale of activity in a tax jurisdiction than aggregated revenues. Aggregated revenues could result in local revenues being double-counted, which might create a misleading impression about the organization's scale of activity in a jurisdiction.  

The organization can also report other sources of revenue, for example, dividends, interest, and royalties, where this is standard practice in the sector of the organization.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-vi  

When reporting profit/loss before tax for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can calculate the consolidated profit/loss before tax for all its resident entities in the jurisdiction.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-vii  

When reporting tangible assets for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can calculate the consolidated total of the net book values of tangible assets for all its resident entities in the jurisdiction.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-viii  

When reporting corporate income tax paid on a cash basis for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can calculate the total actual corporate income tax paid during the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c by all its resident entities in the jurisdiction. This includes cash taxes paid by entities to the jurisdiction of residence and to all other jurisdictions (e.g., withholding taxes incurred in other tax jurisdictions).  

If the tax paid includes a significant amount of withholding tax, the organization can explain this. If taxes are incurred in other tax jurisdictions, the organization can report the amount of tax paid to the other tax jurisdictions separately and identify the jurisdictions where the tax was paid.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-x  

When reporting the reasons for the difference between corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss and the tax due if the statutory tax rate is applied to profit/loss before tax, the organization can describe items that explain the difference, such as tax reliefs, allowances, incentives, or any special tax provisions where an entity benefits from preferential tax treatment.  

The organization can group explanatory items into a generic category, such as ‘other’, if these items together do not exceed $10\%$ of the difference.  

The organization can also report the expiration date, investment requirements, and likely longterm continuity of tax reliefs or incentives for a jurisdiction.  

In addition to providing a qualitative explanation as required by this disclosure, the organization can also report a quantitative corporate tax reconciliation.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-c and clause 2.1  

The organization is required to report information on a regular schedule and make it available in time for information users to make decisions (see the Timeliness principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information). The organization is also recommended to report the information for the same reporting period and publish the information at the same time as its financial reporting, where this is possible (see section 5.1 in GRI 1 for more information). However, the  

information required in Disclosure 207-4 might not be available for reporting until a later point in time.  

If the information required in Disclosure 207-4 is not available for the time period covered by the most recent audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, the organization may report information for the time period covered by the audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public record, immediately preceding the most recent ones.  

Where this time period differs from the reporting period, the organization can specify the reason why.  

# Guidance for clause 2.2.1  

For each of the disclosures specified in clause 2.2.1, the data is considered to be reconciled when the sum of this data for all tax jurisdictions equals the amount reported in the organization’s audited consolidated financial statements or in the financial information filed on public record.  

# Guidance for clause 2.2.3  

When providing information for stateless entities, the organization can also include their jurisdiction of incorporation.  

# Guidance for clause 2.3.1  

Total employee remuneration in a tax jurisdiction can reflect the business value provided by the entities in that jurisdiction to the organization as a whole.  

Total employee remuneration also represents the basis for calculating taxes withheld and paid on behalf of employees, covered under clause 2.3.2.  

# Guidance for clause 2.3.2  

Taxes withheld and paid on behalf of employees refer to taxes withheld by the organization from employee remuneration to be paid to the tax authorities. These can include income taxes, payroll taxes, and social security contributions.  

# Guidance for clause 2.3.3  

Taxes collected from customers refer to taxes and duties charged on and collected on the sales of certain products and services. These are paid by the organization to the tax authorities on behalf of customers.  

# Guidance for clause 2.3.4  

Examples of industry-related and other taxes or payments to governments include:  

industry taxes (e.g., energy tax, airline tax);   
property taxes (e.g., land tax);   
product taxes (e.g., customs duties, alcohol and tobacco duties);   
taxes and duties levied on the supply, use, or consumption of goods and services considered to be harmful to the environment (e.g., vehicle excise duties).  

# Guidance for clause 2.3.5  

When reporting significant uncertain tax positions for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can report the value of the tax positions in line with its audited consolidated financial statements or the financial information filed on public record.  

The organization can provide a description of tax positions that have not been agreed with the relevant tax authorities at the end of the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c. The description can include the nature of the disagreement and the reasons for any change in tax positions that occurred during the time period, where relevant.

# Introduction  

GRI 301: Materials 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their materialsrelated impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its materialsrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s materials-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of materials  

The inputs used to manufacture and package an organization’s products and services can be non-renewable materials, such as minerals, metals, oil, gas, or coal; or renewable materials, such as wood or water. Both renewable and non-renewable materials can be composed of virgin or recycled input materials.  

The type and amount of materials the organization uses can indicate its dependence on natural resources, and the impacts it has on their availability. The organization’s contribution to resource conservation can be indicated by its approach to recycling, reusing and reclaiming materials, products, and packaging.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/2bb44b9a3163da417c0897c24c5b4f462c968506f4bf350cca9913249d2d97b8.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its materials-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined materials to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s materials-related impacts (Disclosure 301-1 through Disclosure 301-3).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined materials to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.

# Introduction  

GRI 302: Energy 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their energy-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its energyrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains five disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s energy-related impacts. The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of energy.  

An organization can consume energy in various forms, such as fuel, electricity, heating, cooling or steam. Energy can be self-generated or purchased from external sources and it can come from renewable sources (such as wind, hydro or solar) or from non-renewable sources such as coal, petroleum or natural gas).  

Using energy more efficiently and opting for renewable energy sources is essential for combating climate change and for lowering an organization’s overall environmental footprint.  

Energy consumption can also occur throughout the upstream and downstream activities connected with an organization’s operations. This can include consumers’ use of products the organization sells, and the end-of-life treatment of these products.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its energy-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined energy to be a material topic:  

• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s energy-related impacts (Disclosure 302-1 through Disclosure 302-5).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined energy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages energy using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also explain whether it is subject to any country, regional, or industry-level energy regulations and policies. Additionally, it can provide examples of these regulations and policies.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total fuel consumption within the organization from non-renewable sources, in joules or multiples, and including fuel types used.   
b. Total fuel consumption within the organization from renewable sources, in joules or multiples, and including fuel types used.  

c. In joules, watt-hours or multiples, the total:  

i. electricity consumption ii. heating consumption iii. cooling consumption iv. steam consumption  

d. In joules, watt-hours or multiples, the total:  

i. electricity sold ii. heating sold iii. cooling sold iv. steam sold  

e. Total energy consumption within the organization, in joules or multiples.  

f. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

g. Source of the conversion factors used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-1, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 avoid the double-counting of fuel consumption, when reporting self-generated energy consumption. If the organization generates electricity from a nonrenewable or renewable fuel source and then consumes the generated electricity, the energy consumption shall be counted once under fuel consumption;   
2.1.2 report fuel consumption separately for non-renewable and renewable fuel sources;   
2.1.3 only report energy consumed by entities owned or controlled by the organization;   
2.1.4 calculate the total energy consumption within the organization in joules or multiples using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Total energy consumption within the organization</td><td>=</td><td>Non-renewablefuel consumed</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>+</td><td>Renewablefuel consumed</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>+</td><td>Electricity, heating, cooling, and steam purchased for consumption</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>+</td><td>Self-generated electricity, heating, cooling, and steam, which are not consumed (see clause 2.1.1)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Electricity, heating, cooling, and steam sold</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-1, the reporting organization should:  

2.2.1 apply conversion factors consistently for the data disclosed;   
2.2.2 use local conversion factors to convert fuel to joules, or multiples, when possible;   
2.2.3 use the generic conversion factors, when local conversion factors are unavailable;   
2.2.4 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them;   
2.2.5 report energy consumption for a consistent group of entities. When possible, the group of entities should also be consistent with the group of entities used in Disclosures 305-1 and 305-2 of GRI 305: Emissions 2016;   
2.2.6 where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of energy consumption data by: 2.2.6.1 business unit or facility; 2.2.6.2 country; 2.2.6.3 type of source (see definitions for the listing of non-renewable sources and renewable sources); 2.2.6.4 type of activity.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

For some organizations, electricity is the only significant form of energy they consume. For others, energy sources such as steam or water provided from a district heating plant or chilled water plant can also be important.  

Energy can be purchased from sources external to the organization or produced by the organization itself (self-generated).  

Non-renewable fuel sources can include fuel for combustion in boilers, furnaces, heaters, turbines, flares, incinerators, generators and vehicles that are owned or controlled by the organization. Non-renewable fuel sources cover fuels purchased by the organization. They also include fuel generated by the organization’s activities – such as mined coal, or gas from oil and gas extraction.  

Renewable fuel sources can include biofuels, when purchased for direct use, and biomass in sources owned or controlled by the organization.  

Consuming non-renewable fuels is usually the main contributor to direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, which are reported in Disclosure 305-1 of GRI 305: Emissions 2016. Consuming purchased electricity, heating, cooling, and steam contributes to the organization’s energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, which are reported in Disclosure 305-2 of GRI 305: Emissions 2016.  

# Disclosure 302-2 Energy consumption outside of the organization  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Energy consumption outside of the organization, in joules or multiples.   
b. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.   
c. Source of the conversion factors used.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-2, the reporting organization shall exclude energy consumption reported in Disclosure 302-1.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-2, the reporting organization should:  

2.4.1 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them;   
2.4.2 list energy consumption outside of the organization, with a breakdown by upstream and downstream categories and activities.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 302-2  

The reporting organization can identify energy consumption outside of the organization by assessing whether an activity’s energy consumption:  

contributes significantly to the organization’s total anticipated energy consumption outside of the organization;   
offers potential for reductions the organization can undertake or influence;   
contributes to climate change-related risks, such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and customer, litigation, and reputational risks;   
is deemed material by stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, investors, or civil society;   
results from outsourced activities previously performed in-house, or that are typically performed in-house by other organizations in the same sector;   
has been identified as significant for the organization’s sector;   
meets any additional criteria for determining relevance, developed by the organization or by organizations in its sector.  

The organization can use the following upstream and downstream categories and activities from the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard’ for identifying relevant energy consumption outside of the organization (see reference [2] in the Bibliography):  

# Upstream categories  

1. Purchased goods and services   
2. Capital goods   
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Disclosure 302-1)   
4. Upstream transportation and distribution   
5. Waste generated in operations   
6. Business travel   
7. Employee commuting   
8. Upstream leased assets   
Other upstream  

# Downstream categories  

1. Downstream transportation and distribution   
2. Processing of sold products   
3. Use of sold products   
4. End-of-life treatment of sold products   
5. Downstream leased assets   
6. Franchises   
7. Investments   
Other downstream  

For each of these categories and activities, the organization can calculate or estimate the amount of energy consumed.  

The organization can report energy consumption separately for non-renewable sources and renewable sources.  

# Background  

Energy consumption can occur outside an organization, i.e., throughout the organization’s upstream and downstream activities associated with its operations.  

This can include consumers’ use of products the organization sells, and the end-of-life treatment of products.  

Quantifying energy consumption outside of the organization can provide a basis for calculating some of the relevant other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions in Disclosure 305-3 of GRI 305: Emissions 2016.  

# Disclosure 302-3 Energy intensity  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Energy intensity ratio for the organization.   
b. Organization-specific metric (the denominator) chosen to calculate the ratio.   
c. Types of energy included in the intensity ratio; whether fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, steam, or all.   
d. Whether the ratio uses energy consumption within the organization, outside of it, or both.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.5 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-3, the reporting organization shall:  

2.5.1 calculate the ratio by dividing the absolute energy consumption (the numerator) by the organization-specific metric (the denominator);   
2.5.2 if reporting an intensity ratio both for the energy consumed within the organization and outside of it, report these intensity ratios separately.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-3, the reporting organization should, where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the energy intensity ratio by:  

2.6.1 business unit or facility;   
2.6.2 country;   
2.6.3 type of source (see definitions for the listing of non-renewable sources and   
renewable sources);   
2.6.4 type of activity.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 302-3  

Intensity ratios can be provided for, among others:  

products (such as energy consumed per unit produced);   
services (such as energy consumed per function or per service);   
sales (such as energy consumed per monetary unit of sales).  

Organization-specific metrics (denominators) can include:  

units of product;   
production volume (such as metric tons, liters, or MWh);   
size (such as $\mathsf{m}^{2}$ floor space);   
number of full-time employees;   
monetary units (such as revenue or sales).  

# Background  

Energy intensity ratios define energy consumption in the context of an organization-specific metric.  

These ratios express the energy required per unit of activity, output, or any other organizationspecific metric. Intensity ratios are often called normalized environmental impact data.  

In combination with the organization’s total energy consumption, reported in Disclosures 302-1 and 302-2, energy intensity helps to contextualize the organization’s efficiency, including in relation to other organizations.  

See references [1] and [3] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Amount of reductions in energy consumption achieved as a direct result of conservation and efficiency initiatives, in joules or multiples.   
b. Types of energy included in the reductions; whether fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, steam, or all.   
c. Basis for calculating reductions in energy consumption, such as base year or baseline, including the rationale for choosing it.   
d. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.7 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-4, the reporting organization shall: 2.7.1 exclude reductions resulting from reduced production capacity or outsourcing; 2.7.2 describe whether energy reduction is estimated, modeled, or sourced from direct If estimation or modeling is used, the organization shall disclose the methods used.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.8 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-4, the reporting organization should, if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 302-4  

The reporting organization can prioritize disclosing reduction initiatives that were implemented in the reporting period, and that have the potential to contribute significantly to reductions. The organization can describe reduction initiatives and their targets when reporting how it manages this topic.  

Reduction initiatives can include:  

process redesign;   
conversion and retrofitting of equipment;   
changes in behavior;   
operational changes.  

The organization can report reductions in energy consumption by combining energy types, or separately for fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, and steam.  

The organization can also provide a breakdown of reductions in energy consumption by individual initiatives or groups of initiatives.  

# Disclosure 302-5 Reductions in energy requirements of products and services  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

a. Reductions in energy requirements of sold products and services achieved during the reporting period, in joules or multiples.   
b. Basis for calculating reductions in energy consumption, such as base year or baseline, including the rationale for choosing it.   
c. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.   
2.9 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-5, the reporting organization should: 2.9.1 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them; 2.9.2 refer to industry use standards to obtain this information, where available (such as fuel consumption of cars for $100~{\mathsf{k m}}$ at $90~\mathsf{k m/h}^{\prime}$ ).  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 302-5  

Use-oriented figures can include, for example, the energy requirements of a car or a compute  

Consumption patterns can include, for example, 10 percent less energy use per $100~{\mathsf{k m}}$ travelled or per time unit (hour, average working day).

# Introduction  

GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their waterrelated impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains two disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its waterrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s water-related impacts. The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of water and effluents.  

Access to fresh water is essential for human life and wellbeing, and is recognized by the United Nations (UN) as a human right. The Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the UN as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, include key targets related to sustainable water management under Goal 6: ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’. These targets aim, for example, to achieve universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, improve water quality, and address water scarcity.  

The amount of water withdrawn and consumed by an organization and the quality of its discharges, can impact the functioning of the ecosystem in numerous ways. Direct impacts on a catchment can have wider  

impacts on the quality of life in an area, including social and economic consequences for local communities and indigenous peoples.  

Since water is a shared resource, and water-related impacts are localized, organizations are increasingly being encouraged to:  

prioritize action in areas with water stress; understand and respond to local contexts, including local social and environmental impacts; aim to benefit and respect the needs and priorities of all water users in an area; align their approaches and collective actions with other water users and with effective public  

Through a comprehensive understanding of its water use, an organization can assess the impacts it has on water resources that benefit the ecosystem, other water users, and the organization itself. An organization, particularly a water-intensive one, can use this information for effective water management.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/b3782411b62c33d21fdc0d3ab07713f64844c38f326420d2fa3f14afb33d6d4e.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its water-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined water and effluents to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s water-related impacts (Disclosure 303-1 through Disclosure 303-5).  

# See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# urther guidance for reporting the disclosures in this Standard  

Due to the strong relationship between water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge, the reporting organization is expected to report on all three topic disclosures of GRI 303.  

Since water-related impacts are often localized, the organization is encouraged, as much as possible, to support any quantitative aggregate-level information with narrative descriptions of any contextual factors that were considered when compiling the information. This will provide a more comprehensive overview of the organization’s water use.  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined water and effluents to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 303-1 through Disclosure 303-2) that are relevant to its water-related impacts.  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages water and effluents using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

The disclosures in this section request essential information to help understand how an organization manages water-related impacts. The reporting organization can report any additional information about its water stewardship efforts and practices.  

An effective approach to managing water and effluents accounts for the local context of water use, and acknowledges the importance of stewarding water as a shared resource. An organization can reduce its water withdrawal, consumption, discharge, and associated impacts through efficiency measures, such as water recycling and reuse, and process redesign, as well as through collective actions that extend beyond its operations within the catchment. It can improve water quality through better treatment of water discharge.  

# Disclosure 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of how the organization interacts with water, including how and where water is withdrawn, consumed, and discharged, and the water-related impacts the organization has caused or contributed to, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships (e.g., impacts caused by runoff).   
b. A description of the approach used to identify water-related impacts, including the scope of assessments, their timeframe, and any tools or methodologies used.   
c. A description of how water-related impacts are addressed, including how the organization works with stakeholders to steward water as a shared resource, and how it engages with suppliers or customers with significant water-related impacts. An explanation of the process for setting any water-related goals and targets that are part of the organization’s approach to managing water and effluents, and how they relate to public policy and the local context of each area with water stress.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.2 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

1.2.1 An overview of water use across the organization’s value chain; 1.2.2 A list of specific catchments where the organization causes significant waterrelated impacts.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-1  

Through its value chain, an organization can affect both the quality as well as the availability of water. If the reporting organization has identified significant water-related impacts in the value chain, which includes activities carried out by the organization, and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization, it is required to report information about these impacts. See Guidance to 3-3-b in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information about reporting an organization’s involvement with negative impacts.  

The description of how the organization interacts with water can include information on specific catchments where water is withdrawn, consumed, and discharged, and information on what the water is used for in  activities carried out by the organization and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization (e.g., for cooling, storage, incorporating in products, growing crops).  

In the context of this Standard, suppliers with significant water-related impacts may include suppliers of water-intensive commodities or services, suppliers located in areas with water stress, and/or suppliers with significant impacts on the local water environment and the related local communities.  

If applicable, the organization can describe its environmental impacts caused by runoff, and how they are addressed. For example, runoff can carry high- nutrient and pollution loads due to the organization’s activities, leading to eutrophication and other negative impacts on local waterbodies.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-1-b  

When assessing impacts, it is important that the organization consider its future impacts on water quality and availability, as these factors can change over time.  

Tools and methodologies for identifying impacts can include life cycle assessments, environmental impact assessments, water footprint assessments, scenario analysis, and stakeholder engagement. If information is estimated or modeled, rather than sourced from direct measurements, the organization can explain its estimation or modeling methods.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-1-c  

Working with stakeholders is critical for an organization to steward water as a shared resource and account for the needs of other water users of the catchment. An organization’s stakeholders  

can include:  

suppliers with significant water-related impacts;   
users of its products and services;   
local communities and action groups;   
employees and other workers;   
other water users in its sector or industry;   
governments, regulators, and civil society organizations;   
global initiatives, trade associations, and partnerships.  

The organization can describe how it participates in discussions with stakeholders, the frequency of this engagement, and its role in these discussions. Outcomes of working with stakeholders can include, for example, collective target-setting for water use, increased investment in infrastructure, policy advocacy, and capacity building and awareness raising.  

When reporting on its engagement with suppliers, the organization can describe:  

how the organization engages with its suppliers to help them improve their water management practices;   
the number of suppliers engaged;   
the outcomes of this engagement;   
the amount of procurement that the proportion of engaged suppliers represents;   
why information is not requested from suppliers with significant water-related impacts;   
future plans and goals for working with suppliers to reduce water-related impacts.  

Water impacts related to products and services might be addressed by, for example, improving product design, providing information and advice on the responsible use of products and services, and holding regular consultations with users.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-1-d  

Meaningful targets for managing water-related impacts:  

account for the local context where water is withdrawn and discharged;   
are scientifically informed by sustainable thresholds and the social context of a given catchment;   
align with public sector efforts, such as the water- related targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 6, or targets set by national and local government institutions;   
are informed by the advocacy of other stakeholders, such as civil society organizations, trade associations, and action groups.  

See references [2] and [4] in the Bibliography.  

The organization can report its progress toward the goals and targets using 3-3-e-iii in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# Guidance for clause 1.2.1  

The organization can present the overview of water use across its value chain as a breakdown, in graphic or written form, showing, for example, parts of the value chain where water consumption is significant and the commodities to which it is related, or the percentage of commodity sourcing that comes from catchments located in areas with water stress. The organization is encouraged to include information about upstream as well as downstream water use (e.g., use of water for consumer products, such as soaps, shampoos, and cleaning solutions).  

# Guidance for clause 1.2.2  

To identify catchments where it causes water-related impacts, the organization can use global catchment data sets. These include the CEO Water Mandate 'Interactive Database of the World's River Basins' , and the WWF 'HydroSHEDS' .  

# Disclosure 303-2 Management of water dischargerelated impacts  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of any minimum standards set for the quality of effluent discharge, and how these minimum standards were determined, including: i. how standards for facilities operating in locations with no local discharge requirements were determined; ii. any internally developed water quality standards or guidelines; iii. any sector-specific standards considered; iv. whether the profile of the receiving waterbody was considered.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-2  

Minimum standards are those that go beyond regulatory requirements in controlling the quality of effluent discharge.  

Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, biological, and taste-related characteristics of water. It is a measure of water suitability for a given purpose or function, including its use as a human right. Water quality standards help uphold water quality in order to protect ecosystems, wildlife, and human health and welfare, and can be based on water properties, such as temperature or pH value.  

The specific choice of water quality standards and parameters can vary depending on an organization’s procucts, services, and facility locations, and can depend on national and/or regional regulations, as well as the profile of the receiving waterbody.

ii. Other water $(>1,000\ m\ g/L$ Total Dissolved Solids).  

d. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 303-3, the reporting organization shall use publicly available and credible tools and methodologies for assessing water stress in an area.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

2.2.1 A breakdown of total water withdrawal in megaliters by withdrawal source categories listed in Disclosure 303-3, at each facility in areas with water stress;   
2.2.2 Total water withdrawal in megaliters by suppliers with significant water-related impacts in areas with water stress.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

The volume of water withdrawal from areas with water stress can indicate an organization’s impacts in sensitive locations.  

To learn more about locations where water-related impacts might be significant, and where actions to address them are most needed, the reporting organization can also report the information requested in Disclosure 303-3 for each facility in areas with water stress. This can give stakeholders more confidence in the organization’s water stewardship efforts and practices.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-3  

For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 303-3, see Table 1.  

Surface water includes collected or harvested rainwater. Third-party water includes water supplied by municipal water networks or other organizations.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-b  

Water stress refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet the human and ecological demand for water. Water stress can refer to the availability, quality, or accessibility of water.  

Publicly available and credible tools for assessing areas with water stress include the World Resources Institute ‘Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas,' and the WWF 'Water Risk Filter'.  

Based on these tools, water stress in an area may be assessed using either of the following indicators and their thresholds:  

The ratio of total annual water withdrawal to total available annual renewable water supply (i.e., baseline water stress) is high $(40-80\%)$ or extremely high $(>80\%)^{3}$ ; The ratio of water consumption-to-availability (i.e., water depletion) is moderate (dry-year depletion, where for at least $10\%$ of the time, the monthly depletion ratio is $>75\%$ ), high (seasonal depletion, where for one month of the year on average, the depletion ratio is $>75\%$ ), or very high (ongoing depletion, where the depletion ratio on average is $>75\%)$ .  

The organization may use these indicators even though they account only for quantity and not the quality or accessibility of water as per the inclusive approach to the definition of water stress.  

The organization can complement the results from these tools with their own assessments, to provide more granular local-level data. Water stress in an area may be measured at catchment level at a minimum.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-b-v  

If water is supplied by a third party, the organization is required to request information about its withdrawal sources, listed in Disclosures 303-3-b-i to 303-3-b-iv, from the third-party water supplier. The organization can report any additional information about third-party water, such as who the third-party water suppliers are and the volume of water supplied by them.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-c  

The organization is required to provide a breakdown of the water withdrawn from each of the sources listed in Disclosures 303-3-a and 303-3-b (surface water, groundwater, seawater, produced water, third-party water) by the categories freshwater and other water. The organization is only required to provide this breakdown for the sources it has withdrawn water from. If all water withdrawn from a source belongs only to one category (i.e., to freshwater or to other water), the organization can report the volume for the remaining category as zero. For example, if all the withdrawn seawater belongs to the other water category, the organization can report the volume of freshwater under this source as zero.  

Other water constitutes any water that has a concentration of total dissolved solids higher than $1,000~\mathsf{m g/L}$ . Other water is therefore all water that does not fall into the freshwater category.  

The organization is, at a minimum, required to report a figure for other water withdrawal for each of the sources listed in Disclosures 303-3-a and 303-3-b.  

The organization can additionally report any further breakdowns for other water withdrawal based on its water management and reporting practices, as long as it explains the approach used to define water quality using Disclosure 303-3-d. The organization can report additional information on how water quality has been determined, including consideration of the potential value of water to its users, as well as any absolute physical and/or chemical criteria used.  

# Guidance for clause 2.2.1  

To compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine which facilities are located in areas with water stress, (b) for each of these facilities, report a breakdown of the total water withdrawal by surface water, groundwater, seawater, produced water, and third-party water. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 2.  

# Guidance for clause 2.2.2  

To compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine which suppliers are located in areas with water stress, (b) determine which of these suppliers cause significant water-related impacts, (c) add up the total water withdrawal of each of these suppliers, (d) report the sum. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 3.  

# Disclosure 303-4 Water discharge  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total water discharge to all areas in megaliters, and a breakdown of this total by the following types of destination, if applicable:  

i. Surface water;   
ii. Groundwater;   
iii. Seawater;   
iv. Third-party water, and the volume of this total sent for use to other organizations, if applicable.  

b. A breakdown of total water discharge to all areas in megaliters by the following categories:  

i. Freshwater $\leq1,000\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{L}$ Total Dissolved Solids);   
ii. Other water $\mathbf{\rho}_{\lvert>1,000\ m g/L}$ Total Dissolved Solids).  

c. Total water discharge to all areas with water stress in megaliters, and a breakdown of this total by the following categories:  

i. Freshwater $\yen1,000,0$ Total Dissolved Solids);   
ii. Other water $(>1,000\ m\ g/L$ Total Dissolved Solids).  

d. Priority substances of concern for which discharges are treated, including:  

i. how priority substances of concern were defined, and any international standard, authoritative list, or criteria used; ii. the approach for setting discharge limits for priority substances of concern; iii. number of incidents of non-compliance with discharge limits.  

e. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 303-4, the reporting organization shall use publicly available and credible tools and methodologies for assessing water stress in an area.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.4 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

2.4.1 The number of occasions on which discharge limits were exceeded;   
2.4.2 A breakdown of total water discharge to all areas in megaliters by level of treatment, and how the treatment levels were determined;   
2.4.3 Percentage of suppliers with significant water-related impacts from water discharge that have set minimum standards for the quality of their effluent discharge.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Quantifying the volume of water discharge can help an organization understand its negative impacts on the receiving waterbody.  

The relationship between water discharge and negative impacts is not linear. An increase in the total volume of water discharge does not necessarily correspond to greater negative impacts, since these impacts depend on the quality of the water discharge and the sensitivity of the receiving waterbody. An organization with a high volume of water discharge, but also a high level of treatment and strict quality standards, can have positive impacts on the receiving waterbody.  

To learn more about locations where water-related impacts might be significant, and where actions to address them are most needed, the reporting organization can also report the information requested in Disclosure 303-4 for each facility in areas with water stress.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-4  

For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 303-4, see Table 1.  

See Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-b for how to assess areas with water stress.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-4-a-iv  

An example of third-party water discharge is when an organization sends water and effluents to other organizations for use. In these instances, the organization is required to report the volume of this water discharge separately.  

# Guidance for Disclosures 303-4-b and 303-4-c  

The organization is required to provide a breakdown of the water discharged to all areas and to all areas with water stress by the categories freshwater and other water. Other water constitutes any water that has a concentration of total dissolved solids higher than $1,000~\mathrm{mg/L}$ . Other water is therefore all water that does not fall into the freshwater category.  

The organization is, at a minimum, required to report a figure for other water discharged. The organization can additionally report any further breakdowns for other water discharge based on its water management and reporting practices, as long as it explains the approach used to define water quality using Disclosure 303-4-e. The organization can report additional information on how water quality has been determined, including consideration of the potential value of water to its users, as well as any absolute physical and/or chemical criteria used.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-4-d  

In the context of this Standard, substances of concern are those that cause irreversible damage to the waterbody, ecosystem, or human health.  

Discharge limits for substances of concern can be based on regulation and/or other factors determined by an organization. In countries where no regulations for discharge limits are available, the organization can develop its own discharge limits.  

‘Discharge consent’ is the permission granted to an organization, allowing it to discharge a set amount of a substance. The organization can report any unauthorized discharges that exceed these limits using Disclosure 303-4-d. The organization can also describe any plans to reduce unauthorized discharges in the future.  

# Guidance for clause 2.4.2  

Reporting water discharge by level of treatment can provide insight into the effort an organization is making to improve the quality of its water discharge. When reporting how the treatment levels were determined, the organization is expected to include the reasons why a certain level of treatment was set.  

The level of treatment can be reported for any water or effluents at the point of discharge, whether treated by the organization onsite or sent to a third party for treatment.  

Water treatment involves physical, chemical or biological processes that improve water quality by removing solids, pollutants, and organic matter from water and effluents. Minimum requirements for treatment might be specified in national, state, or local legislation; however, the organization is expected to consider its overall water discharge impacts and the needs of other water users in setting treatment levels.  

The organization can break down its water discharge by the following treatment levels:  

Primary treatment, which aims to remove solid substances that settle or float on the water surface;   
Secondary treatment, which aims to remove substances and materials that have remained in the water, or are dissolved or suspended in it;   
Tertiary treatment, which aims to upgrade water to a higher level of quality before it is It includes processes that remove, for example, heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus.  

An organization might withdraw and discharge water of good quality that does not require treatment. If so, the organization can explain this in its reported information.  

# Guidance for clause 2.4.3  

Minimum standards are those that go beyond regulatory requirements in controlling the quality of effluent discharge. For more information on water quality standards, see Disclosure 303-2 in the Topic management disclosures section.  

To compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine the number of suppliers with significant water-related impacts from water discharge, (b) determine how many of these suppliers have set minimum standards for the quality of their effluent discharge, (c) calculate the percentage using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentage of suppliers with significant water-related impacts from water discharge that have set minimum standards for the quality of their effluent discharge 二</td><td rowspan="3">X100</td></tr><tr><td>Number of suppliers that have set minimum standards for the quality of their effluent discharge</td></tr><tr><td>Number of suppliers with significant water-related impacts from water discharge</td></tr></table></body></html>  

For an example of how to present this information, see Table 3.  

# Disclosure 303-5 Water consumption  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total water consumption from all areas in megaliters.   
b. Total water consumption from all areas with water stress in megaliters.   
c. Change in water storage in megaliters, if water storage has been identified as having a significant water-related impact.   
d. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used, including whether the information is calculated, estimated, modeled, or sourced from direct measurements, and the approach taken for this, such as the use of any sector-specific factors.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.5 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

2.5.1 Total water consumption in megaliters at each facility in areas with water stress; 2.5.2 Total water consumption in megaliters by suppliers with significant water-related impacts in areas with water stress.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Water consumption measures water used by an organization such that it is no longer available for use by the ecosystem or local community in the reporting period. Reporting the volume of water consumption can help the organization understand the overall scale of its impact due to water withdrawal on downstream water availability.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-5  

For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 303-5, see Table 1.  

See Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-b for how to assess areas with water stress.  

If the reporting organization cannot directly measure water consumption, it may calculate this using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Water consumption</td><td>二</td><td>Total water withdrawal</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Total water discharge</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Guidance for Disclosure 303-5-c  

If the water in storage has been identified as having a significant water-related impact, the organization is required to report change in water storage. The organization may calculate change in water storage using the following formula:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Change in water storage 二</td><td>Total water storage at the end of the reporting period</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total water storage at the beginning of the reporting</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>period</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Guidance for clause 2.5.1  

To compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine which facilities are located in areas with water stress, (b) for each of these facilities, report the total water consumption. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 2.  

# Guidance for clause 2.5.2  

To compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine which suppliers are located in areas with water stress, (b) determine which of these suppliers cause significant water-related impacts, (c) add up the total water consumption of each of these suppliers, (d) report the sum. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 3.

# Introduction  

GRI 304: Biodiversity 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their biodiversity-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its biodiversity-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains four disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s biodiversity-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of biodiversity.  

Protecting biological diversity is important for ensuring the survival of plant and animal species, genetic diversity, and natural ecosystems. In addition, natural ecosystems provide clean water and air, and contribute to food security and human health. Biodiversity also contributes directly to local livelihoods, making it essential for achieving poverty reduction, and thus sustainable development.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the United Nations: see Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/dcae18c9067e145c18948f89c4aa67970370b8f6a258a7c14d376f7d61cbd301.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its biodiversity-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined biodiversity to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s biodiversity-related impacts (Disclosure 304-1 through Disclosure 304-4).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined biodiversity to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages biodiversity using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also describe its strategy for achieving its policy on biodiversity management. A biodiversity strategy can contain a combination of elements related to the prevention, management, and remediation of damage to natural habitats resulting from the organization’s activities. An example of this is the integration of biodiversity considerations into analytical tools, such as environmental site impact assessments.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 304-1 Operational sites owned, leased, managed in, or adjacent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. For each operational site owned, leased, managed in, or adjacent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas, the following information:  

i. Geographic location;   
ii. Subsurface and underground land that may be owned, leased, or managed by the organization;   
iii. Position in relation to the protected area (in the area, adjacent to, or containing portions of the protected area) or the high biodiversity value area outside protected areas;   
iv. Type of operation (office, manufacturing or production, or extractive);   
v. Size of operational site in $\mathbf{km}^{2}$ (or another unit, if appropriate);   
vi. Biodiversity value characterized by the attribute of the protected area or area of high biodiversity value outside the protected area (terrestrial, freshwater, or maritime ecosystem);   
vii. Biodiversity value characterized by listing of protected status (such as IUCN Protected Area Management Categories, Ramsar Convention, national legislation).  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 304-1, the reporting organization should include information about sites for which future operations have been formally announced.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Monitoring which activities are taking place in both protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas makes it possible for the organization to reduce the risks of impacts. It also makes it possible for the organization to manage impacts on biodiversity or to avoid mismanagement.  

# Disclosure 304-2 Significant impacts of activities, products and services on biodiversity  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Nature of significant direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity with reference to one or more of the following:  

i. Construction or use of manufacturing plants, mines, and transport infrastructure;   
ii. Pollution (introduction of substances that do not naturally occur in the habitat from point and non-point sources);   
iii. Introduction of invasive species, pests, and pathogens;   
iv. Reduction of species;   
v. Habitat conversion;   
vi. Changes in ecological processes outside the natural range of variation (such as salinity or changes in groundwater level).  

b. Significant direct and indirect positive and negative impacts with reference to the following:  

i. Species affected;   
ii. Extent of areas impacted;   
iii. Duration of impacts;   
iv. Reversibility or irreversibility of the impacts.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 304-2  

Indirect impacts on biodiversity can include impacts in the supply chain.  

Areas of impact are not limited to areas that are formally protected and include consideration of impacts on buffer zones, as well as formally designated areas of special importance or sensitivity.  

# Background  

This disclosure provides the background for understanding (and developing) an organization’s strategy to mitigate significant direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. By presenting structured and qualitative information, the disclosure enables comparison of the relative size, scale, and nature of impacts over time and across organizations.  

# Disclosure 304-3 Habitats protected or restored  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Size and location of all habitat areas protected or restored, and whether the success of the restoration measure was or is approved by independent external professionals.   
b. Whether partnerships exist with third parties to protect or restore habitat areas distinct from where the organization has overseen and implemented restoration or protection measures.   
c. Status of each area based on its condition at the close of the reporting period.   
d. Standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.   
2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 304-3, the reporting organization should align the information presented in this disclosure with regulatory or license requirements for the protection or restoration of habitats, if applicable.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 304-3  

This disclosure addresses the extent of an organization’s prevention and remediation activities with respect to its impacts on biodiversity. This disclosure refers to areas where remediation has been completed or where the area is actively protected. Areas where operations are still active can be counted if they conform to the definitions of ‘area restored’ or ‘area protected’.  

# Disclosure 304-4 IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by the operations of the organization, by level of extinction risk:  

i. Critically endangered ii. Endangered iii. Vulnerable iv. Near threatened v. Least concern  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 304-4, the reporting organization should compare the information in the IUCN Red List and national conservation lists with the species outlined in planning documentation and monitoring records to ensure consistency.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure helps an organization to identify where its activities pose a threat to endangered plant and animal species. By identifying these threats, the organization can initiate appropriate steps to avoid harm and to prevent the extinction of species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ‘Red List of Threatened Species’ (an inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species) and national conservation lists serve as authorities on the sensitivity of habitat in areas affected by operations, and on the relative importance of these habitats from a management perspective.  

See reference [8] in the Bibliography.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.  

# A  

# area of high biodiversity value  

area not subject to legal protection, but recognized for important biodiversity features by a number of governmental and non-governmental organizations  

Note 1: Areas of high biodiversity value include habitats that are a priority for conservation, which are often defined in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans prepared under the United Nations (UN) Convention, ‘Convention on Biological Diversity’, 1992.  

# Note 2:  

Several international conservation organizations have identified particular areas of high biodiversity value.  

# area protected  

area that is protected from any harm during operational activities, and where the environment remains in its original state with a healthy and functioning ecosystem  

# area restored  

area that was used during or affected by operational activities, and where remediation measures have either restored the environment to its original state, or to a state where it has a healthy and functioning ecosystem  

# human rights  

# H  

rights inherent to all human beings, which include, at a minimum, the rights set out in the United Nations (UN) International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work

# protected area  

geographic area that is designated, regulated, or managed to achieve specific conservation objectives  

# significant impact on biodiversity  

impact that can adversely affect the integrity of a geographic area or region, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features, structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its population levels, and the particular species that make the habitat important cannot be sustained  

Note 1: On a species level, a significant impact causes a population decline or change in distribution so that natural recruitment (reproduction or immigration from unaffected areas) cannot return to former levels within a limited number of generations.   
Note 2: A significant impact can also affect subsistence or commercial resource use to the degree that the well-being of users is affected over the long term.  

# sustainable development / sustainability  

development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

# Introduction  

GRI 305: Emissions 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their emissions-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains requirements, which provide information about how the organization manages its emissionsrelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s emissions-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses emissions into air, which are the discharge of substances from a source into the atmosphere. Types of emissions include: greenhouse gas (GHG), ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and nitrogen oxides $(\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{X}})$ and sulfur oxides $(\mathsf{S O}_{\mathsf{X}})$ , among other significant air emissions.  

# GHG emissions  

GHG emissions are a major contributor to climate change and are governed by the United Nations (UN) ‘Framework Convention on Climate Change’ and the subsequent UN ‘Kyoto Protocol’.  

This Standard covers the following GHGs:  

Carbon dioxide $(\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ ) Methane $(C H_{4}$ ) Nitrous oxide $(\mathsf{N}_{2}\mathsf{O})$ Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) Sulphur hexafluoride $(\mathsf{S F}_{6})$ Nitrogen trifluoride $(\mathsf{N F}_{3})$ )  

Some GHGs, including methane, are also air pollutants that have significant negative impacts on ecosystems, air quality, agriculture, and human and animal health.  

As a result, different national and international regulations and incentive systems, such as emissions trading, aim to control the volume and reward the reduction of GHG emissions.  

The requirements for GHG emissions in this Standard are based on the requirements of the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’) and the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’). These two standards are part of the GHG Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD).  

The GHG Protocol has established a classification of GHG emissions called 'Scope': Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3. The GHG emissions standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ‘ISO 14064’, represents these classifications of Scope with the following terms:  

Direct GHG emissions $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Scope I Energy indirect GHG emissions $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Scope 2 Other indirect GHG emissions $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Scope 3  

In this Standard, these terms are combined in the following way, as defined in the Glossary section:  

Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions  

# Ozone-depleting substances (ODS)  

The ozone layer filters out most of the sun’s biologically harmful ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation. Observed and projected ozone depletion due to ODS generates worldwide concern. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) ‘Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ (‘Montreal Protocol’) regulates the phase-out of ODS internationally.  

# Nitrogen oxides $(\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{X}})$ , sulfur oxides $(\mathsf{S O}_{\mathsf{X}})$ , and other significant air emissions  

Pollutants such as $\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{x}}$ and $\mathsf{S O}_{\mathsf{x}}$ have negative impacts on climate, ecosystems, air quality, habitats, agriculture, and human and animal health. Deterioration of air quality, acidification, forest degradation and public health concerns have led to local and international regulations to control emissions of these pollutants.  

Reductions in the emission of regulated pollutants lead to improved health conditions for workers and local communities and can enhance relations with affected stakeholders. In regions with emission caps, the volume of emissions also has direct cost implications.  

Other significant air emissions include, for example, persistent organic pollutants or particulate matter, as well as air emissions that are regulated under international conventions and/or national laws or regulations, including those listed on an organization’s environmental permits.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/819c4817965e8a23bcb437d921d8346d928a90125be1c09553f147a4c46512b9.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its emissions-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined emissions to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Clause 1.2 in this Standard, if it is relevant to its emissions-related impacts;   
Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s emissions-related impacts (Disclosure 305-1 through Disclosure 305-7).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these requirements and disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined emissions to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to report clause 1.2 in this section, if it is relevant to its emissions-related impacts.  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages emissions using Disclosure 3- 3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

1.2 When reporting on GHG emissions targets, the reporting organization shall explain whether offsets were used to meet the targets, including the type, amount, criteria or scheme of which the offsets are part.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also:  

explain whether it is subject to any country, regional, or industry-level emissions regulations and policies; and provide examples of these regulations and policies; disclose expenditures on treatment of emissions (such as expenditures for filters, agents) and for the purchase and use of emissions certificates.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in metric tons of $\underline{{\mathsf{c o}}}_{2}$ equivalent.   
b. Gases included in the calculation; whether $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ , $\mathsf{c H}_{4}$ , ${\ensuremath{\mathbb{N}}}_{2}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{O}}}$ , HFCs, PFCs, $\mathsf{s F}_{6},\mathsf{N F}_{3}$ , or all.   
c. Biogenic $\underline{{\mathsf{c o}}}_{2}$ emissions in metric tons of $\underline{{\mathsf{c o}}}_{2}$ equivalent.   
d. Base year for the calculation, if applicable, including: i. the rationale for choosing it; ii. emissions in the base year; iii. the context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base year emissions.   
e. Source of the emission factors and the global warming potential (GWP) rates used, or a reference to the GWP source.   
f. Consolidation approach for emissions; whether equity share, financial control, or operational control.   
g. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-1, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 exclude any GHG trades from the calculation of gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions;   
2.1.2 report biogenic emissions of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately from the gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions. Exclude biogenic emissions of other types of GHG (such as $\mathsf{c H}_{4}$ and $\ensuremath{\mathsf{N}}_{2}\circ)$ , and biogenic emissions of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ that occur in the life cycle of biomass other than from combustion or biodegradation (such as GHG emissions from processing or transporting biomass).  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-1, the reporting organization should:  

2.2.1 apply emission factors and GWP rates consistently for the data disclosed;   
2.2.2 use the GWP rates from the IPCC assessment reports based on a 100-year timeframe;   
2.2.3 select a consistent approach for consolidating direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions; choosing from the equity share, financial control, or operational control methods outlined in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’;   
2.2.4 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them;   
2.2.5 where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions by: 2.2.5.1 business unit or facility; 2.2.5.2 country; 2.2.5.3 type of source (stationary combustion, process, fugitive); 2.2.5.4 type of activity.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-1  

Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions from the fuel consumption as reported in Disclosure 302-1 of GRI 302: Energy 2016.  

Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions can come from the following sources owned or controlled by an organization:  

Generation of electricity, heating, cooling and steam: these emissions result from   
combustion of fuels in stationary sources, such as boilers, furnaces, and turbines – and from other combustion processes such as flaring;   
Physical or chemical processing: most of these emissions result from the manufacturing or processing of chemicals and materials, such as cement, steel, aluminum, ammonia, and waste processing;   
Transportation of materials, products, waste, workers, and passengers: these emissions result from the combustion of fuels in mobile combustion sources owned or controlled by the organization, such as trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, buses, and cars;   
Fugitive emissions: these are emissions that are not physically controlled but result from intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs. These can include equipment leaks from joints, seals, packing, and gaskets; methane emissions (e.g., from coal mines) and venting; HFC emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment; and methane leakages (e.g., from gas transport).  

Methodologies used to calculate the direct (Scope I) GHG emissions can include:  

direct measurement of energy source consumed (coal, gas) or losses (refills) of cooling systems and conversion to GHG ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ equivalents);   
mass balance calculations;   
calculations based on site-specific data, such as for fuel composition analysis;   
calculations based on published criteria, such as emission factors and GWP rates;   
direct measurements of GHG emissions, such as continuous online analyzers;   
estimations.  

If estimations are used due to a lack of default figures, the reporting organization can indicate the basis and assumptions on which figures were estimated.  

For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’.  

The chosen emission factors can originate from mandatory reporting requirements, voluntary reporting frameworks, or industry groups.  

Estimates of GWP rates change over time as scientific research develops. GWP rates from the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used as the basis for international negotiations under the ‘Kyoto Protocol’. Thus, such rates can be used for disclosing GHG emissions where it does not conflict with national or regional reporting requirements. The organization can also use the latest GWP rates from the most recent IPCC assessment report.  

The organization can combine Disclosure 305-1 with Disclosures 305-2 (energy indirect/Scope 2 GHG emissions) and 305-3 (other indirect/Scope 3 GHG emissions) to disclose total GHG emissions.  

Further details and guidance are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’. See also references [1], [2], [12], [13], [14] and [19] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions

b. If applicable, gross market-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in metric tons of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ equivalent.   
c. If available, the gases included in the calculation; whether $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ , $\mathsf{c H}_{4}$ , $N_{2}O$ , HFCs, PFCs, ${\mathsf{s F}}_{6},{\mathsf{N F}}_{3}$ , or all.   
d. Base year for the calculation, if applicable, including: i. the rationale for choosing it; ii. emissions in the base year; iii. the context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base year emissions.   
e. Source of the emission factors and the global warming potential (GWP) rates used, or reference to the GWP source.   
f. Consolidation approach for emissions; whether equity share, financial control, or operational control.   
g. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-2, the reporting organization shall:  

2.3.1 exclude any GHG trades from the calculation of gross energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions;   
2.3.2 exclude other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions that are disclosed as specified in Disclosure 305-3;   
2.3.3 account and report energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions based on the location- based method, if it has operations in markets without product or supplier-specific data;   
2.3.4 account and report energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions based on both the location-based and market-based methods, if it has any operations in markets providing product or supplier-specific data in the form of contractual instruments.

2.4.5 where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions by: 2.4.5.1 business unit or facility; 2.4.5.2 country; 2.4.5.3 type of source (electricity, heating, cooling, and steam);  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-2  

Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the $\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by an organization – disclosed as specified in Disclosure 302-1 of GRI 302: Energy 2016. For many organizations, the energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions that result from the generation of purchased electricity can be much greater than their direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions.  

The ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance’ requires organizations to provide two distinct Scope 2 values: a location-based and a market-based value. A location- based method reflects the average GHG emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs, using mostly grid-average emission factor data. A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that an organization has purposefully chosen (or its lack of choice). It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.  

The market-based method calculation also includes the use of a residual mix, if the organization does not have specified emissions-intensity from its contractual instruments. This helps prevent double counting between consumers’ market-based method figures. If a residual mix is unavailable, the organization can disclose this and use grid-average emission factors as a proxy (which can mean that the location-based and market- based are the same number until information on the residual mix is available).  

The reporting organization can apply the Quality Criteria in the ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance so that contractual instruments convey GHG emission rate claims and to prevent double counting. See reference [18] in the Bibliography.  

For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’.  

The chosen emission factors can originate from mandatory reporting requirements, voluntary reporting frameworks, or industry groups.  

Estimates of GWP rates change over time as scientific research develops. GWP rates from the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC are used as the basis for international negotiations under the ‘Kyoto Protocol’. Thus, such rates can be used for disclosing GHG emissions where it does not conflict with national or regional reporting requirements. The organization can also use the latest GWP rates from the most recent IPCC assessment report.  

The organization can combine Disclosure 305-2 with Disclosures 305-1 (direct/Scope 1 GHG emissions) and 305-3 (other indirect/Scope 3 GHG emissions) to disclose total GHG emissions.  

Further details and guidance are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’. Details on the location-based and market-based methods are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance’. See also references [1], [2], [12], [13], [14] and [18] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 305-3 Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Gross other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions in metric tons of $\underline{{\mathsf{c o}}}_{2}$ equivalent.   
b. If available, the gases included in the calculation; whether $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ , $\mathsf{c H}_{4}$ , $N_{2}O$ , HFCs, PFCs, $\mathsf{s F}_{6}$ , ${\mathsf{N F}}_{3}$ , or all.   
c. Biogenic $\underline{{\mathsf{C O}_{2}}}$ emissions in metric tons of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ equivalent.   
d. Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions categories and activities included in the calculation.   
e. Base year for the calculation, if applicable, including: i. the rationale for choosing it; ii. emissions in the base year; iii. the context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base year emissions.   
f. Source of the emission factors and the global warming potential (GWP) rates used, or a reference to the GWP source.   
g. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.5 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-3, the reporting organization shall:  

2.5.1 exclude any GHG trades from the calculation of gross other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions;   
2.5.2 exclude energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions from this Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions are disclosed as specified in Disclosure 305-2;   
2.5.3 report biogenic emissions of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass that occur in its value chain separately from the gross other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions. Exclude biogenic emissions of other types of GHG (such as $C H_{4}$ and $N_{2}O_{2}^{\prime}$ ), and biogenic emissions of $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ that occur in the life cycle of biomass other than from combustion or biodegradation (such as GHG emissions from processing or transporting biomass).  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-3, the reporting organization should:  

2.6.1 apply emission factors and GWP rates consistently for the data disclosed;   
2.6.2 use the GWP rates from the IPCC assessment reports based on a 100-year timeframe;   
2.6.3 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them;   
2.6.4 list other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, with a breakdown by upstream and downstream categories and activities;   
2.6.5 where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions by: 2.6.5.1 business unit or facility; 2.6.5.2 country; 2.6.5.3 type of source; 2.6.5.4 type of activity.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-3  

Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions are a consequence of an organization’s activities, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the organization. Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions include both upstream and downstream emissions. Some examples of Scope 3 activities include extracting and producing purchased materials; transporting purchased fuels in vehicles not owned or controlled by the organization; and the end use of products and services.  

Other indirect emissions can also come from the decomposing of the organization’s waste. Process-related emissions during the manufacture of purchased goods and fugitive emissions in facilities not owned by the organization can also produce indirect emissions.  

For some organizations, GHG emissions that result from energy consumption outside of the organization can be much greater than their direct (Scope 1) or energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions.  

The reporting organization can identify other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions by assessing which of its activities’ emissions:  

contribute significantly to the organization’s total anticipated other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions;   
offer potential for reductions the organization can undertake or influence;   
contribute to climate change-related risks, such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and customer, litigation, and reputational risks;   
are deemed material by stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, investors, or civil society;   
result from outsourced activities previously performed in-house, or that are typically performed in-house by other organizations in the same sector;   
have been identified as significant for the organization’s sector;   
meet any additional criteria for determining relevance, developed by the organization or by organizations in its sector.  

The organization can use the following upstream and downstream categories and activities from the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’ (see reference [15] in the Bibliography).  

# Upstream categories  

1. Purchased goods and services   
2. Capital goods   
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2)   
4. Upstream transportation and distribution   
5. Waste generated in operations   
6. Business travel   
7. Employee commuting   
8. Upstream leased assets   
Other upstream  

# Downstream categories  

9. Downstream transportation and distribution   
10. Processing of sold products   
11. Use of sold products   
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products   
13. Downstream leased assets   
14. Franchises   
15. Investments   
Other downstream  

For each of these categories and activities, the organization can provide a figure in ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ equivalent or explain why certain data are not included.  

For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’.  

The chosen emission factors can originate from mandatory reporting requirements, voluntary reporting frameworks, or industry groups.  

Estimates of GWP rates change over time as scientific research develops. GWP rates from the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC are used as the basis for international negotiations under the ‘Kyoto Protocol’. Thus, such rates can be used for disclosing GHG emissions where it does not conflict with national or regional reporting requirements. The organization can also use the latest GWP rates from the most recent IPCC assessment report.  

The organization can combine Disclosure 305-3 with Disclosures 305-1 (direct/Scope 1 GHG emissions) and 305-2 (energy indirect/Scope 2 GHG emissions) to disclose total GHG emissions.  

See references [1], [2], [12], [13], [15], [17] and [19] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 305-4 GHG emissions intensity  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. GHG emissions intensity ratio for the organization.   
b. Organization-specific metric (the denominator) chosen to calculate the ratio.   
c. Types of GHG emissions included in the intensity ratio; whether direct (Scope 1), energy indirect (Scope 2), and/or other indirect (Scope 3).   
d. Gases included in the calculation; whether $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ , $\mathsf{c H}_{4}$ , $N_{2}O$ , HFCs, PFCs, $\mathsf{s F}_{6},\mathsf{N F}_{3}$ , or all.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.7 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-4, the reporting organization shall: 2.7.1 calculate the ratio by dividing the absolute GHG emissions (the numerator) by the organization-specific metric (the denominator); 2.7.2 if reporting an intensity ratio for other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, report this intensity ratio separately from the intensity ratios for direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) emissions.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

8 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-4, the reporting organization should, where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the GHG emissions intensity ratio by:  

2.8.1 business unit or facility;   
2.8.2 country;   
2.8.3 type of source;   
2.8.4 type of activity.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-4  

Intensity ratios can be provided for, among others:  

products (such as metric tons of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions per unit produced);   
services (such as metric tons of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions per function or per service);   
sales (such as metric tons of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions per sales).  

Organization-specific metrics (denominators) can include:  

units of product;   
production volume (such as metric tons, liters, or MWh);   
size (such as ${\mathfrak{m}}^{2}$ floor space);   
number of full-time employees;   
monetary units (such as revenue or sales).  

The reporting organization can report an intensity ratio for direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions combined, using the figures reported in Disclosures 305-1 and 305- 2.  

# Background  

Intensity ratios define GHG emissions in the context of an organization-specific metric. Many organizations track environmental performance with intensity ratios, which are often called normalized environmental impact data.  

GHG emissions intensity expresses the amount of GHG emissions per unit of activity, output, or any other organization-specific metric. In combination with an organization’s absolute GHG emissions, reported in Disclosures 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3, GHG emissions intensity helps to contextualize the organization’s efficiency, including in relation to other organizations.  

See references [13], [14], and [19] in the Bibliography.

b. Gases included in the calculation; whether $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ , $C H_{4}$ , $N_{2}O$ , HFCs, PFCs, $\mathsf{\pmb{s F_{6}}}$ , ${\mathsf{N F}}_{3}$ , or all.   
c. Base year or baseline, including the rationale for choosing it.   
d. Scopes in which reductions took place; whether direct (Scope 1), energy indirect (Scope 2), and/or other indirect (Scope 3).   
e. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.9 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-5, the reporting organization shall:  

2.9.1 exclude reductions resulting from reduced production capacity or outsourcing;   
2.9.2 use the inventory or project method to account for reductions;   
2.9.3 calculate an initiative’s total reductions of GHG emissions as the sum of its associated primary effects and any significant secondary effects;   
2.9.4 if reporting two or more Scope types, report the reductions for each separately;   
2.9.5 report reductions from offsets separately.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.10 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-5, the reporting organization should, if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-5  

The reporting organization can prioritize disclosing reduction initiatives that were implemented in the reporting period, and that have the potential to contribute significantly to reductions. The organization can describe reduction initiatives and their targets when reporting how it manages this topic.  

Reduction initiatives can include:  

process redesign;   
conversion and retrofitting of equipment;   
fuel switching;   
changes in behavior;   
offsets.  

The organization can report reductions disaggregated by initiatives or groups of initiatives.  

This disclosure can be used in combination with Disclosures 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3 of this Standard to monitor the reduction of GHG emissions with reference to the organization’s targets, or to regulations and trading systems at international or national level.  

See references [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], and [19] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance for clause 2.9.2  

The inventory method compares reductions to a base year. The project method compares reductions to a baseline. Further details on these methods are available in references [15] and [16] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance for clause 2.9.3  

Primary effects are the elements or activities designed to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon storage. Secondary effects are smaller, unintended consequences of a reduction initiative, including changes to production or manufacture, which result in changes to GHG  

emissions elsewhere. See reference [14] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 305-6 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Production, imports, and exports of ODS in metric tons of CFC-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) equivalent.   
b. Substances included in the calculation.   
c. Source of the emission factors used.   
d. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.  

Compilation requirements  

2.11 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-6, the reporting organization shall:  

2.11.1 calculate the production of ODS as the amount of ODS produced, minus the amount destroyed by approved technologies, and minus the amount entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other chemicals;  

<html><body><table><tr><td>ProductionofODs 二</td><td>ODSproduced</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ODS destroyed by approved technologies</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ODS entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other chemicals</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 2.11.2 exclude ODS recycled and reused.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.12 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-6, the reporting organization   
should: 2.12.1 if subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them; 2.12.2 where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the ODS data by: 2.12.2.1 business unit or facility; 2.12.2.2 country; 2.12.2.3 type of source; 2.12.2.4 type of activity.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 305-6  

The reporting organization can report separate or combined data for the substances included in the calculation.  

# Background  

Measuring ODS production, imports, and exports helps to indicate how an organization complies with legislation. This is particularly relevant if the organization produces or uses ODS in its processes, products and services and is subject to phase-out commitments. Results on ODS phase-out help to indicate the organization’s position in any markets affected by regulation on ODS.  

This disclosure covers the substances included in Annexes A, B, C, and E of the ‘Montreal Protocol’ as well as any other ODS produced, imported, or exported by an organization.  

See references [1], [2], [8] and [9] in the Bibliography.

# carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent  

measure used to compare the emissions from various types of greenhouse gas (GHG) based on their global warming potential (GWP)  

Note: The ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ equivalent for a gas is determined by multiplying the metric tons of the gas by the associated GWP.  

# CFC11 (trichlorofluoromethane) equivalent  

measure used to compare various substances based on their relative ozone depletion potential (ODP)  

Note: The reference level of 1 is the potential of CFC-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) and CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) to cause ozone depletion.  

# direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions  

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization  

Example: ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions from fuel consumption  

Note: A GHG source is any physical unit or process that releases GHG into the atmosphere.

Most ODS are controlled under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, and its amendments, and include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, and methyl bromide.  

# reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  

decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or increase in removal or storage of GHG from the atmosphere, relative to baseline emissions  

Note:  

Primary effects will result in GHG reductions, as will some secondary effects. An initiative’s total GHG reductions are quantified as the sum of its associated primary effect(s) and any significant secondary effects (which may involve decreases or countervailing increases in GHG emissions).  

# Scope of GHG emissions  

classification of the operational boundaries where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occur  

Note 1: Scope classifies whether GHG emissions are created by the organization itself, or are created by other related organizations, for example electricity suppliers or logistics companies.  

Note 2:  

There are three classifications of Scope: Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3.  

Note 3:  

The classification of Scope derives from the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 2004.

# Introduction  

GRI 306: Waste 2020 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their waste-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on how it prevents waste generation and how it manages waste that cannot be prevented, in its own activities and upstream and downstream in its value chain.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains two disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its wasterelated impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s waste-related impacts. The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of waste.  

Waste can be generated in the organization’s own activities, for example, during the production of its products and delivery of services. It can also be generated by entities upstream and downstream in the organization’s value chain, for example, when suppliers process materials that are later used or procured by the organization, or when consumers use the services or discard the products that the organization sells to them.  

Waste can have significant negative impacts on the environment and human health when inadequately managed. These impacts often extend beyond locations where waste is generated and discarded. The resources and materials contained in waste that is incinerated or landfilled are lost to future use, which accelerates their depletion.  

The United Nations recognizes the role of responsible consumption and production in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals . The targets under Goal 12, in particular, call on organizations to implement environmentally sound waste management and prevent and reduce waste through reuse and recycling.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its waste-related impacts. This Standard can also be used by organizations that manage waste generated by other organizations, such as public and private waste management organizations. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 301: Materials 2016.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined waste to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s waste-related impacts (Disclosure 306-1 through Disclosure 306-5).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the  

item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined waste to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 306-1 through Disclosure 306-2) that are relevant to its wasterelated impacts.  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# 1.1  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages waste using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# Disclosure 306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. For the organization’s significant actual and potential waste-related impacts, a description of:  

i. the inputs, activities, and outputs that lead or could lead to these impacts; ii. whether these impacts relate to waste generated in the organization’s own activities or to waste generated upstream or downstream in its value chain.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.2 The reporting organization should report a process flow of inputs, activities, and outputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

The quantity, type, and quality of waste generated by an organization is a consequence of the activities involved in the production of its products and services (e.g., extraction, processing, procurement of materials, product or service design, production, distribution) and their subsequent consumption. An assessment of how materials move into, through, and out of the organization can help understand where in the organization’s value chain these materials eventually become waste. This provides a holistic overview of waste generation and its causes, which in turn can support the organization in identifying opportunities for waste prevention and for adopting circularity measures. In this way, the organization can go beyond mitigating and remediating negative impacts once waste has been generated and move towards managing waste as a resource.

When reporting on this disclosure, the organization can specify the types of inputs and outputs. The types of inputs and outputs can include raw materials, process and manufacturing materials, leaks and losses, waste, by-products, products, or packaging.  

The organization can assess and report whether inputs, activities, and outputs lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts using the following criteria:  

Quantity of inputs used to produce the organization’s products or services, which will become waste after they are used for production.   
Quantity of waste outputs generated in the organization’s own activities, or quantity of outputs it provides to entities downstream that will eventually become waste when they reach their end of life. Hazardous characteristics of inputs and outputs.   
Properties of input materials or design characteristics of outputs that limit or prevent their recovery or limit the length of their life.   
Known potential negative threats associated with specific materials when they are discarded. For example, the potential threat of marine pollution resulting from leakage of discarded plastic packaging into waterbodies. Types of activities that lead to significant quantities of waste generation or to generation of hazardous waste.  

The organization is required to report on inputs that it receives from entities upstream in its value chain, as well as outputs it provides to entities downstream in its value chain. For example, if an organization procures components with hazardous characteristics from a supplier and uses these in a product that will continue to carry these components and their hazardous characteristics, the organization is required to report these components under inputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts. Similarly, if an organization sells to consumers products that generate large quantities of packaging waste, it is required to report this packaging under outputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts.  

If the organization has identified many inputs and outputs or many activities that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts, it may group these by:  

product or service category that the inputs and outputs relate to;   
business units or facilities that procure the inputs, or whose activities produce the outputs;  

categories of upstream and downstream activities that produce the outputs (for examples of upstream and downstream categories, see the guidance for Disclosure 302-2 in GRI 302: Energy 2016).  

# Guidance for clause 1.2  

A process flow is a tool to visualize the information required to be reported under Disclosure 306-1. A graphic illustration of the process flow can help the organization and its stakeholders understand how inputs and outputs move through the organization’s own activities as well as through the activities of entities upstream and downstream in its value chain. It shows where waste is generated in the value chain or where outputs become waste.  

The organization can also use the process flow to illustrate information that is required under other disclosures of this Standard, such as:  

actions taken to prevent waste generation (Disclosure 306-2);   
composition of waste generated (Disclosure 306-3);   
recovery operations used to divert waste from disposal (Disclosure 306-4);   
disposal operations (Disclosure 306-5).  

The organization can include estimates of the weight of inputs and the weight of outputs in metric tons or the ratio of inputs to outputs.  

For examples of process flow illustrations, see the Appendix.  

# Disclosure 306-2 Management of significant wasterelated impacts  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Actions, including circularity measures, taken to prevent waste generation in the organization’s own activities and upstream and downstream in its value chain, and to manage significant impacts from waste generated.   
b. If the waste generated by the organization in its own activities is managed by a third party, a description of the processes used to determine whether the third party manages the waste in line with contractual or legislative obligations.   
c. The processes used to collect and monitor waste-related data.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

An organization can cause waste-related impacts through its own activities. For example, when its operations generate waste outputs. It can also contribute to waste-related impacts through activities carried out in its value chain upstream or downstream. For example, through criteria in its procurement policies that lead to waste generation upstream, or through management decisions that limit the life of its products and therefore contribute to waste generation downstream.  

Even when the organization has not contributed to waste-related impacts upstream or downstream in its value chain, its operations, products, or services could be directly linked to waste-related impacts by its business relationships with the entities in its value chain. For example, when third parties hired by the organization carry out inadequate recovery or disposal operations.  

The way an organization is involved with negative impacts is important for determining the organization’s response to an impact.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-a  

Actions, including circularity measures, to prevent waste generation and to manage significant impacts from waste generated can include:  

Input material choices and product design:  

Improving materials selection and product design through consideration for longevity and durability, repairability, modularity and disassembly, and recyclability.   
Reducing the use of raw and finite materials by procuring secondary materials (e.g., used or recycled input materials) or renewable materials.   
Substituting inputs that have hazardous characteristics with inputs that are non  
hazardous.  

Collaboration in the value chain and business model innovation:  

Setting policies for procurement from suppliers that have sound waste prevention and waste management criteria.   
Engaging in or setting up industrial symbiosis as a result of which the organization’s waste or other outputs (e.g., by-products from production) become inputs for another organization.   
Participating in a collective or individual extended producer responsibility scheme or applying product stewardship, which extends the producer’s responsibility for a product or service to its end of life.   
Transitioning to and applying new business models, such as product service systems that use services instead of products to meet consumer demand.   
Engaging in or setting up product take-back schemes and reverse logistics processes to divert products and materials from disposal.  

End-of-life interventions:  

Establishing and improving facilities for waste management, including facilities for the collection and sorting of waste.   
Recovering products, components, and materials from waste through preparation for reuse and recycling.   
Engaging with consumers to raise awareness about sustainable consumption practices,  

such as reduced purchasing of products, product sharing, exchange, reuse, and recycling.  

See references [9] and [11] in the Bibliography.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-b  

This disclosure can provide insight into the level of control the organization assumes for waste management outsourced to a third party. In the context of this Standard, a third party includes a public or private waste management organization, or any other entity or group of individuals formally or informally involved in handling the reporting organization’s waste. Waste management by third parties can include the collection, transportation, recovery, and disposal of waste, as well as the supervision of such operations and the aftercare of disposal sites. The organization may specify agreements in a contract for the third party to follow when managing its waste, or rely on existing legislative obligations, such as local environmental laws and regulations, to ensure that the third party manages the waste adequately.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-c  

The processes that the organization has in place for collecting and monitoring waste-related data can reflect its commitment to managing waste-related impacts. Such processes can include online data entry, maintaining a centralized database, real-time weighbridge measurement, and annual external data validation.  

The organization can specify whether the data collection and monitoring processes extend beyond waste generated in its own activities to include waste generated upstream and downstream in its value chain.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 306-3 Waste generated  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total weight of waste generated in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by composition of the waste.   
b. Contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 306-3-a, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under total waste;   
2.1.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

The total weight of waste generated, when contrasted with the weight of waste that the organization directs to recovery and disposal, can show the extent to which the organization manages its waste-related impacts.  

The composition of the waste generated can help identify recovery or disposal operations appropriate to the type of waste and to the specific materials present in the waste.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-3  

This disclosure covers waste generated in the organization’s own activities. The organization can separately report waste generated upstream and downstream in its value chain, if this information is available.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-3-a  

When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:  

the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste; the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector); the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals, plastics, textiles).  

Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix Tables.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-3-b  

To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference between the weight of waste generated and the weight of waste directed to recovery or disposal. This difference can be a result of precipitation or evaporation, leaks or losses, or other modifications to the waste. In the context of this Standard, leaks result from physical or technical failures (e.g., a trail of waste from a waste collection truck), while losses result from inadequate security measures or administrative failures (e.g., theft or lost records).  

To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.  

See references [1], [4], [10], and [11] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 306-4 Waste diverted from disposal  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total weight of waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by composition of the waste.   
b. Total weight of hazardous waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by the following recovery operations: i. Preparation for reuse; ii. Recycling; iii. Other recovery operations.  

c. Total weight of non-hazardous waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by the following recovery operations:  

i. Preparation for reuse;   
ii. Recycling;   
iii. Other recovery operations.  

d. For each recovery operation listed in Disclosures 306-4-b and 306-4-c, a breakdown of the total weight in metric tons of hazardous waste and of non-hazardous waste diverted from disposal:

2.2.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under total waste;   
2.2.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.  

2.3 The reporting organization should report the total weight of waste prevented, and the baseline and methodology for this calculation.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

An organization’s choice of operations to manage waste shows how it addresses significant waste-related impacts. The options to manage waste can be informed by the waste management hierarchy, which orders operations to manage waste from the most preferable to the least preferable. The waste management hierarchy prioritizes waste prevention, followed by recovery operations that divert waste from being sent to disposal, such as preparation for reuse, recycling, and other recovery operations.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-4  

Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix Tables.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-a  

When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:  

the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste; • the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector); the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals, plastics, textiles).  

# Guidance for Disclosures 306-4-b and 306-4-c  

When reporting on Disclosures 306-4-b-ii and 306-4-c-ii, the organization can specify the type of recycling operations, such as downcycling, upcycling, composting, or anaerobic digestion.  

Besides preparation for reuse and recycling, the organization can report the other types of recovery operations it uses under Disclosures 306-4-b-iii and 306-4-c-iii, such as repurposing or refurbishment.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-d  

Reporting on the quantity and type of waste diverted from disposal onsite and offsite shows the extent to which the organization knows how its waste is managed. In the context of this Standard, ‘onsite’ means within the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting organization, and ‘offsite’ means outside the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting organization.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-e  

To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference between the weights of waste diverted from disposal onsite and offsite (e.g., lack of infrastructure onsite to recover materials from waste). It can also describe sector practices, sector standards, or external regulations that mandate a specific recovery operation.  

To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.  

# Guidance for clause 2.3  

Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, as it prevents the resulting impacts on the environment and human health. The organization can calculate waste prevented as the reduction in waste generation resulting from the actions reported under Disclosure 306-2-a. Reductions in waste generation resulting from reduced production capacity are not considered waste prevention. The organization can report waste prevented in its own activities as well as waste prevented in entities upstream and downstream in its value chain.  

See reference [1] in the Bibliography.  

# Disclosure 306-5 Waste directed to disposal  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total weight of waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by composition of the waste. Total weight of hazardous waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by the following disposal operations:  

i. Incineration (with energy recovery);   
ii. Incineration (without energy recovery);   
iii. Landfilling;   
iv. Other disposal operations.  

c. Total weight of non-hazardous waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by the following disposal operations:  

i. Incineration (with energy recovery);   
ii. Incineration (without energy recovery);   
iii. Landfilling;   
iv. Other disposal operations.  

d. For each disposal operation listed in Disclosures 306-5-b and 306-5-c, a breakdown of the total weight in metric tons of hazardous waste and of non-hazardous waste directed to disposal:  

i. onsite;   
ii. offsite.  

e. Contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled.  

Compilation requirements  

2.4 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 306-5, the reporting organization shall:  

2.4.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under total waste;   
2.4.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Disposal is the least preferable option in the waste management hierarchy because of its negative impacts on the environment and human health. Leachate from landfills can contaminate land and water, methane released from the decay of organic waste in landfills contributes to climate change, and uncontrolled burning of waste contributes to air pollution. Disposal prevents the materials present in the waste from being recirculated in the environment and economy, making them unavailable for future use.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-5  

Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix Tables.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-a  

When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:  

the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste; the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector); the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals, plastics, textiles).  

# Guidance for Disclosures 306-5-b and 306-5-c  

Besides incineration and landfilling, the organization can specify the other types of disposa  

operations it uses under Disclosures 306-5-b-iv and 306-5-c-iv, such as dumping, open burning, or deep well injection.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-d  

Reporting the quantity and type of waste directed to disposal onsite and offsite shows the extent to which the organization knows how its waste is managed. In the context of this Standard, ‘onsite’ means within the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting organization, and ‘offsite’ means outside the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting organization.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-e  

To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference between the weights of waste directed to disposal onsite and offsite (e.g., local regulations that prohibit landfilling of specific types of waste). It can also describe sector practices, sector standards, or external regulations that mandate a specific disposal operation.  

To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.

# Introduction  

GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their environmental impacts in their supply chain, and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on its approach to preventing and mitigating negative environmental impacts in its supply chain.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its environmental impacts in its supply chain.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s supplier assessment and environmental impacts in its supply chain.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of supplier environmental assessment.  

An organization may be involved with negative environmental impacts either through its own activities or as a result of its business relationships with other parties. Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent, mitigate, and address actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain. These include negative impacts the organization either causes or contributes to, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the United Nations: see Bibliography.  

Suppliers can be assessed for a range of environmental criteria such as impacts related to energy, water, or emissions. Some of these criteria are covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 302: Energy 2016, GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, GRI 305: Emissions 2016).  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/fe3b148e4001eac997ce1a68db22dac786677f8a0881d15b5b609a67369bd319.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its environmental impacts in its supply chain. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016.  

If the reporting organization has determined both supplier environmental assessment and supplier social assessment to be material, it can combine its disclosures for GRI 308 and GRI 414. For example, if the organization uses the same approach for managing both topics, it can provide one combined explanation of how the organization manages both topics.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined supplier environmental assessment to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s environmental impacts in its supply chain (Disclosure 308-1 through Disclosure 308-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined supplier environmental assessment to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages supplier environmental assessment using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also disclose:  

the systems used to screen new suppliers using environmental criteria, and a list of the environmental criteria used to screen new suppliers;   
processes used, such as due diligence, to identify and assess significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain;   
how the organization identifies and prioritizes suppliers for assessment of environmental impacts;   
actions taken to address the significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts identified in the supply chain, and whether the actions are intended to prevent, mitigate, or remediate the impacts;   
how expectations are established and defined in contracts with suppliers to promote the prevention, mitigation, and remediation of significant actual and potential negative   
environmental impacts, including targets and objectives;   
whether suppliers are incentivized and rewarded for the prevention, mitigation, and   
remediation of significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts;   
practices for assessing and auditing suppliers and their products and services using environmental criteria;   
a list of the type, system, scope, frequency, current implementation of assessment and audit, and which parts of the supply chain have been certified and audited;   
the systems in place to assess the potential negative impacts of terminating a relationship with a supplier as a result of assessing the supplier for environmental impacts, and the organization’s strategy to mitigate those impacts.  

Environmental criteria or assessments of suppliers for environmental impacts can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 302: Energy 2016, GRI 303: Water and Eflluents 2018, GRI 305: Emissions 2016).  

Negative impacts can include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.  

Assessments can be informed by audits, contractual reviews, two-way engagement, and complaint and grievance mechanisms.  

Actions taken to address environmental impacts can include changing an organization’s procurement practices, adjusting performance expectations, capacity building, training, changes to processes, as well as terminating supplier relationships.  

Assessments and audits of suppliers and their products and services using environmental criteria can be undertaken by an organization, by a second party, or by a third party.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 308-1 New suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria.  

# GUIDANCE  

Guidance for Disclosure 308-1 Environmental criteria can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 302: Energy 2016, GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, GRI 305: Emissions 2016)  

# Background  

This disclosure informs stakeholders about the percentage of suppliers selected or contracted subject to due diligence processes for environmental impacts.  

An organization is expected to initiate due diligence as early as possible in the development of a new relationship with a supplier.  

Impacts may be prevented or mitigated at the stage of structuring contracts or other agreements, as well as via ongoing collaboration with suppliers.  

# Disclosure 308-2 Negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Number of suppliers assessed for environmental impacts.   
b. Number of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts.   
c. Significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts identified in the supply chain.   
d. Percentage of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts with which improvements were agreed upon as a result of assessment.   
e. Percentage of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts with which relationships were terminated as a result of assessment, and why.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 308-2, the reporting organization should, where it provides appropriate context on significant impacts, provide a breakdown of the information by:  

2.1.1 the location of the supplier;   
2.1.2 the significant actual and potential negative environmental impact.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 308-2  

Negative impacts include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.  

Assessments for environmental impacts can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 302: Energy 2016, GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, GRI 305: Emissions 2016).  

Assessments can be made against agreed performance expectations that are set and communicated to the suppliers prior to the assessment.  

Assessments can be informed by audits, contractual reviews, two-way engagement, and complaint and grievance mechanisms.  

Improvements can include changing an organization’s procurement practices, the adjustment of performance expectations, capacity building, training, and changes to processes.  

# Background  

This disclosure informs stakeholders about an organization’s awareness of significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Introduction  

GRI 401: Employment 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their employmentrelated impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its employment-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s employment-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of employment. This includes an organization’s approach to employment or job creation, that is, an organization’s approach to hiring, recruitment, retention and related practices, and the working conditions it provides. The Standard also covers the employment and working conditions in an organization’s supply chain.  

An employment relationship is a legal relationship between a worker and an organization that confers rights and obligations to both parties. This relationship is usually the means for determining whether employment or labor law is applicable or whether commercial law is applicable.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/c4c556a2a9ea7277d9d04b705af2fa30b5cc4871ff4bd97d62e586f9a1e3c342.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its employment-related impacts. In addition to this Standard, conditions of work are also covered in detail in other GRI Standards:  

GRI 402: Labor/Management Relations 2016   
GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018   
GRI 404: Training and Education 2016   
GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016   
GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016  

In addition, Disclosure 2-7 and Disclosure 2-8 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 require information on employees and other workers performing work for the organization, such as the total number of employees, and the total number of permanent and temporary employees, by gender and by region.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined employment to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s employment-related impacts (Disclosure 401-1 through Disclosure 401-3).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined employment to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages employment using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.2 The reporting organization should describe:  

1.2.1 its policies or practices covering the relationships under which work is performed for the organization;   
1.2.2 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken within its supply chain does not take place within appropriate institutional and legal frameworks;   
1.2.3 actions taken to determine and address situations where persons working for suppliers are not provided the social and labor protection that they are entitled to receive by national labor law;   
1.2.4 actions taken to determine and address situations where working conditions in its supply chain do not meet international labor standards or national labor law;   
1.2.5 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken in its supply chain is inadequately remunerated;   
1.2.6 actions taken to determine and address situations of disguised employment relationships where workers in its supply chain are falsely considered to be selfemployed or where there is no legally recognized employer;   
1.2.7 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken in its supply chain that is performed at home is not subject to legally recognized contracts.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for clause 1.2  

Policies or practices covering the relationships under which work is performed for an organization can include recognized employment relationships, the use of employees of other organizations (such as workers supplied by agencies), and the extent to which work is performed on a temporary or part-time basis. A description of policies and practices can include policies and practices with respect to discrimination, compensation, promotion, privacy, human resource development and industrial relations.  

Work taking place within an appropriate institutional and legal framework usually entails a recognized employment relationship with an identifiable and legally recognized employer.  

Conditions of work can include compensation, working time, rest periods, holidays, disciplinary and dismissal practices, maternity protection, the workplace environment, and occupational health and safety. They can also include the quality of living accommodations where provided, and welfare matters, such as safe drinking water, canteens and access to medical services.  

Adequately remunerated work is work where wages and compensation for a standard working week, excluding overtime, meet legal and industry minimum standards, and are sufficient to meet the basic needs of workers and their families, and to provide them with some discretionary income. Actions taken to address situations where work is inadequately remunerated can include:  

dialogue with suppliers regarding the relationship of the prices paid to suppliers and the wages paid to workers;   
changes to an organization’s procurement practices;   
support for collective bargaining to determine wages;   
determining the extent that overtime is used, whether it is mandatory, and whether it is compensated at a premium rate.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number and rate of new employee hires during the reporting period, by age group, gender and region.   
b. Total number and rate of employee turnover during the reporting period, by age group, gender and region.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-1, the reporting organization shall use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting period to calculate the rates of new employee hires and employee turnover. See Standard Interpretations.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-1, the reporting organization should use data from Disclosure 2-7 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of employees.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 401-1  

An organization can use the following age groups:  

Under 30 years old;   
30-50 years old;   
Over 50 years old.  

# Background  

The number, age, gender, and region of an organization’s new employee hires can indicate its strategy and ability to attract diverse, qualified employees. This information can signify the organization’s efforts to implement inclusive recruitment practices based on age and gender. It can also signify the optimal use of available labor and talent in different regions.  

A high rate of employee turnover can indicate levels of uncertainty and dissatisfaction among employees. It can also signal a fundamental change in the structure of an organization’s core operations. An uneven pattern of turnover by age or gender can indicate incompatibility or potential inequity in the workplace. Turnover results in changes to the human and intellectual capital of the organization and can impact productivity. Turnover has direct cost implications either in terms of reduced payroll or greater expenses for the recruitment of employees.  

# Disclosure 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or parttime employees  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Benefits which are standard for full-time employees of the organization but are not provided to temporary or part-time employees, by significant locations of operation. These include, as a minimum:  

i. life insurance;   
ii. health care;   
iii. disability and invalidity coverage;   
iv. parental leave;   
v. retirement provision;   
vi. stock ownership;   
vii. others.  

b. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.  

Compilation requirements  

2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-2, the reporting organization shall exclude in-kind benefits such as provision of sports or child day care facilities, free meals during working time, and similar general employee welfare programs.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Data reported under this disclosure provide a measure of an organization’s investment in human resources and the minimum benefits it offers its full-time employees. The quality of benefits for full-time employees is a key factor in retaining employees.  

# Disclosure 401-3 Parental leave  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of employees that were entitled to parental leave, by gender.   
b. Total number of employees that took parental leave, by gender.   
c. Total number of employees that returned to work in the reporting period after parental leave ended, by gender.   
d. Total number of employees that returned to work after parental leave ended that were still employed 12 months after their return to work, by gender.   
e. Return to work and retention rates of employees that took parental leave, by gender.   
2.4 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-3, the reporting organizatio should use the following formulas to calculate the return to work and retention rates:  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Return to work rate</td><td colspan="2">Total number of employees that did return to work after parentalleave</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of employees due to return to work after taking parental leave</td><td>X100</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Retention rate</td><td>Total number of employees retained 12 months after returning to work following a period of parental leave</td><td rowspan="2">X100</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of employees returning from parental leave in the prior reporting period(s)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 401-3  

Employees entitled to parental leave means those employees that are covered by organizational policies, agreements or contracts that contain parental leave entitlements.  

To determine who returned to work after parental leave ended and were still employed 12 months later, an organization can consult records from the prior reporting periods.  

# Background  

Many countries have introduced legislation to provide parental leave. The aim of the legislation is to allow employees to take leave and return to work in the same or a comparable position.  

The application of legislation varies according to interpretation by government, employers and employees. Many women are discouraged from taking leave and returning to work by employer practices that affect their employment security, remuneration and career path. Many men are not encouraged to take the leave to which they are entitled.  

Equitable gender choice for maternity and paternity leave, and other leave entitlements, can lead to the greater recruitment and retention of qualified employees. It can also boost employee morale and productivity. Men’s uptake of paternity leave options can indicate the degree to which an organization encourages fathers to take such leave. Men taking advantage of leave entitlements positively impacts women to take such leave without prejudicing their career path.

# Relevant section  

Clause 2.1 in GRI 401: Employment 2016  

# Issue  

Disclosure 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover in GRI 401: Employment 2016 requires organizations to report the total numbers and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover during the reporting period, by age group, gender and region.  

Clause 2.1 in GRI 401 further requires organizations to use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting period to calculate the rates of new employee hires and employee turnover.  

Feedback from users of the GRI Standards indicated that the required methodology in clause 2.1 is incorrect.  

# Interpretation Statement  

An organization is not required to comply with clause 2.1 in GRI 401: Employment 2016 (‘The reporting organization shall use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting period to calculate the rates of new employee hires and employee turnover’).  

The organization is free to choose the methodology for calculating these rates.  

The organization is recommended to adequately describe data measurements and bases for calculations (see the Accuracy principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021). When using ratios or normalized data, the organization is recommended to report total numbers or absolute data and provide explanatory notes (see the Comparability principle in GRI 1).

# Introduction  

GRI 402: Labor/Management Relations 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to labor/management relations, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to labor/management relations.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to labor/management relations.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of labor/management relations. This covers an organization’s consultative practices with employees and their representatives, including its approach to communicating significant operational changes.  

An organization’s consultation practices are expected to be aligned with relevant international norms and standards.  

Collective bargaining can play an important role in an organization’s consultation practices. Collective bargaining refers to all negotiations that take place between one or more employers or employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions), on the other, for determining working conditions and terms of employment or for regulating relations between employers and workers.1  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see Bibliography.  

Reporting on collective bargaining is covered in more detail in GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 2016. In addition, Disclosure 2-30 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires reporting on the percentage of total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation  

to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to labor/management relations.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined labor/management relations to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to labor/management relations (Disclosure 402-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this  

information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined labor/management relations to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages labor/management relations using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 402-1 Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Minimum number of weeks’ notice typically provided to employees and their representatives prior to the implementation of significant operational changes that could substantially affect them.   
b. For organizations with collective bargaining agreements, report whether the notice period and provisions for consultation and negotiation are specified in collective agreements.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 402-1  

Minimum notice periods can be found in corporate policies and standard employment contracts.   
Different policy statements can exist at a regional level.  

An organization can identify the collective bargaining agreements referred to in Disclosure 2-30 of GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021, and review the notice period clauses within these documents.  

# Background  

Organizations are expected to provide reasonable notice of significant operational changes to employees and their representatives, as well as to appropriate government authorities. Minimum notice periods are a measure of an organization’s ability to maintain employee satisfaction and motivation while implementing significant changes to operations.  

This disclosure provides insight into an organization’s practice of ensuring timely discussion of significant operational changes, and engaging with its employees and their representatives to negotiate and implement these changes, which can have positive or negative implications for workers.  

This disclosure also allows an assessment of an organization’s consultation practices in relation to expectations expressed in relevant international norms.  

The essence of consultation is that management takes the views of workers into account when making specific decisions. Therefore, it is important that consultation takes place before a decision is made. Meaningful consultation includes the timely provision of all information needed to make an informed decision to workers or their representatives. Genuine consultation involves dialogue; opinion surveys and questionnaires are not considered consultation.  

Timely and meaningful consultation allows the affected parties to understand the impacts of the changes, such as possible loss of employment. It also gives an opportunity for them to work collectively to prevent or mitigate negative impacts as much as possible (see references [11] and [12] in the Bibliography). Consultative practices that result in good industrial relations help to provide positive working environments, reduce turnover, and minimize operational disruptions.

# Introduction  

GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their occupational health and safety-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its occupational health and safety-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s occupational health and safety-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of occupational health and safety.  

Healthy and safe work conditions are recognized as a human right and addressed in authoritative intergovernmental instruments, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Health Organization (WHO): see the Bibliography.  

Healthy and safe work conditions are also a target of the Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the United Nations (UN) as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.1  

Healthy and safe work conditions involve both prevention of physical and mental harm, and promotion of workers health.  

Prevention of harm and promotion of health require an organization to demonstrate commitment to workers' health and safety. They also require the organization to engage workers in the development, implementation, and performance evaluation of an occupational health and safety policy, management system and programs that are appropriate to the organization’s size and activities.  

It is essential that workers are consulted in the development of an organization’s occupational health and safety policy, and participate in the processes necessary to plan, support, operate, and continually evaluate the effectiveness of the occupational health and safety management system and programs.  

Hazard identification and risk assessment, worker training, and incident identification and investigation are also key to planning, supporting, operating, and evaluating the occupational health and safety management system.  

In addition to preventing harm, an organization can promote workers’ health by offering healthcare services or voluntary health promotion services and programs, which, for example, help workers improve their diet or quit smoking. These additional services and programs cannot serve as a substitute for occupational health and safety programs, services and systems that prevent harm and protect workers from work-related injuries and ill health.  

All services and programs that aim to prevent harm and promote workers’ health are expected to respect workers’ right to privacy. Organizations are expected not to use workers' participation in such services and programs, or the health data derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding employment or engagement of workers, including termination, demotion, promotion or offering of prospects, compensation, or any other favorable or unfavorable treatment.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/ed4a482c7ed9cd05b5f6ec5a605e7ea5badd738dc8bab9a8a81875f4dc710d5b.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its occupational health and safety-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined occupational health and safety to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s occupational health and safetyrelated impacts (Disclosure 403-1 through Disclosure 403-10).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# Scope of ‘workers’ in this Standard  

In the context of the GRI Standards, the term ‘worker’ is defined as a person that performs work. Some GRI Standards specify the use of a particular subset of workers.  

This Standard covers the following subset of workers, for whose occupational health and safety an organization is expected to be responsible:  

All workers who are employees (i.e., those workers who are in an employment relationship with the organization according to national law or practice);   
All workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization; All workers who are not employees and whose work and workplace are not controlled by the organization, but the organization’s operations, products, or services are directly linked to significant occupational health and safety impacts on those workers by its business relationships.  

See Table 1 for examples of employees and workers who are not employees according to the criteria of ‘control of work’ and ‘control of workplace’.  

When the reporting organization does not have data available for all the workers specified in a disclosure, the organization is required to identify the types of worker excluded from the disclosures and explain why they have been excluded. See also Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for requirements on reasons for omission.  

# Workers who are employees  

All employees are to be included by the organization in its reported data, regardless of whether the organization controls their work and/or workplace.  

For employees, the organization is required to report the topic management disclosures (except Disclosure 403-7) and the topic disclosures.  

# Workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization  

Workers who are not employees might include agency workers, contractors, self-employed persons, and volunteers, among other types of worker. Workers who are not employees might include those working for the organization, or for the organization’s suppliers, customers, or other business partners.  

Note that the worker type does not determine whether the worker is to be included by the organization in its reported data. Workers, of any type, are to be included if the organization controls their work and/or workplace, because these forms of control position the organization to take action to eliminate hazards and minimize risks, to protect workers from harm.  

Control of work implies that the organization has control over the means or methods, or directs the work performed with respect to its occupational health and safety performance. Control of workplace implies that the organization has control over the physical aspects of the workplace (e.g., access to the workplace), and/or the type of activities that can be performed in the workplace.  

The organization might have sole control of the work and/or workplace, or share control with one or more organizations (e.g., suppliers, customers, or other business partners, such as in joint ventures). In cases of shared control, workers of the organization’s business partner are to be included in the reported data when there is a contractual obligation between the organization and the partner, and the organization shares control over the means or methods, or shares direction of the work performed, and/or over the workplace. In such cases, through contractual obligation, the organization can require the partner to, for example, use a less harmful chemical in its products or production process.  

For workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, the organization is required to report the topic management disclosures (except Disclosure 403-7) and the topic disclosures.  

Workers who are not employees and whose work and workplace are not controlled by the organization, but the organization’s operations, products, or services are directly linked to significant occupational health and safety impacts on those workers by its business relationships  

An organization is expected to be responsible for the occupational health and safety of employees and of workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace it controls. Beyond that, an organization might also be involved with occupational health and safety impacts as a result of its business relationships with other entities, such as entities in its value chain.  

In cases where an organization has no control over both the work and workplace, it still has a responsibility to make efforts, including exercising any leverage it might have, to prevent and mitigate negative occupational health and safety impacts that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships.  

In these cases, the organization is required, at a minimum, to describe its approach to preventing and mitigating significant negative occupational health and safety impacts and the related hazards and risks, using Disclosure 403- 7 in the Topic management disclosures section.

Contractors hired by the reporting organization to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Workers of a supplier to the reporting organization who work on the supplier's premises, and where the organization instructs the supplier to use particular materials or work methods in manufacturing/delivering the required goods or services.</td><td>Example: Workers of a supplier contracted by the reporting organization who work on the supplier's premises using the supplier's work methods. For instance, the reporting organization sources buttons and thread from a supplier, which are standard products of the supplier. The supplier's workers make the buttons and thread at the supplier's workplace. The organization, however, learns that the buttons are coated with a sealant that releases toxic gases when being applied by workers, thereby affecting their health. In this case, the organization has no control over both the work and workplace of the supplier's workers, but its products are directly linked to significant occupational health and safety impacts on those workers by its business relationship with the supplier.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined occupational health and safety to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 403-1 through Disclosure 403-7) that are relevant to its occupational health and safety-related impacts.  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages occupational health and safety using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.   
1.2 The reporting organization should report any other leading indicators or measures used to inform the management and evaluation of the occupational health and safety performance.  

# GUIDANCE  

If the operations of the reporting organization span a large number of countries or sites, it may group the topic management disclosures across countries or sites by relevant categories. For example, the organization may group information required in Disclosure 403-4-b on formal joint management-worker health and safety committees across sites with similar characteristics together; it does not have to report on each committee separately.  

# Guidance for clause 1.2  

Leading indicators measure an organization’s performance in relation to the actions it takes to prevent work-related injuries and ill health. They are important because organizations cannot rely solely on lagging indicators, which might not give a true picture of their occupational health and safety performance due to issues such as long-latency ill health and underreporting.  

Leading indicators are often unique or tailored to a specific organization. Examples of such indicators include the number of workers trained in hazard identification and incident reporting, the increase in reporting of hazards and incidents after implementation of reporting policy and processes and worker training, the frequency of health and safety inspections or audits, the average time it takes to implement the recommendations of an inspection or audit, and response times for the investigation and elimination of hazards.

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-2-a  

When describing the processes used to identify hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis, and to apply the hierarchy of controls, the reporting organization can:  

specify whether these processes are based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines;   
describe the frequency and scope of processes undertaken on a routine basis;   
describe the triggers for processes undertaken on a non-routine basis, such as changes in operating procedures or equipment; incident investigations; worker complaints or referrals; changes in workers or workflow; results of surveillance of work environment and worker health, including exposure monitoring (e.g., exposure to noise, vibration, dust); explain how obstacles to the implementation of these processes are removed for workers who might be more vulnerable to the risk of work-related injury or ill health, such as workers facing language barriers or having visual or hearing impairments (e.g., by providing occupational health and safety training and information in a language easily understood by workers).  

# Guidance for Disclosures 403-2-b and 403-2-c  

Protecting workers against reprisals involves putting policies and processes in place that provide them with protection against intimidation, threats, or acts that could have a negative impact on their employment or work engagement, including termination, demotion, loss of compensation, discipline, and any other unfavorable treatment. Workers might face reprisals on account of their decision to either remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury or ill health, or for reporting hazards or hazardous situations to their workers’ representatives, to their employer, or to regulatory authorities.  

Disclosure 403-2-c covers the right of workers to refuse or stop unsafe or unhealthy work. Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause them or another person injury or ill health.  

# Disclosure 403-3 Occupational health services  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information for employees and for workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:  

a. A description of the occupational health services’ functions that contribute to the identification and elimination of hazards and minimization of risks, and an explanation of how the organization ensures the quality of these services and facilitates workers’ access to them.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.3 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

1.3.1 How the organization maintains the confidentiality of workers’ personal healthrelated information;   
1.3.2 How the organization ensures that workers’ personal health-related information and their participation in any occupational health services is not used for any favorable or unfavorable treatment of workers.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-3  

Occupational health services aim to protect the health of workers in relation to their work environment.  

When describing how the quality of occupational health services is ensured, the reporting organization can explain whether the services are provided by competent individuals with recognized qualifications and accreditations, and whether it complies with legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines.  

When describing how it facilitates workers’ access to occupational health services, the organization can describe whether it provides these services at the workplace and during working hours; whether it arranges transport to health clinics or expedites service there; whether it provides information about the services, including in a language easily understood by workers; and whether it adjusts workloads to allow workers to make use of these services.  

The organization can also report the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these services, and the approaches used to raise awareness about them and encourage participation.  

# Guidance for clauses 1.3.1 and 1.3.2  

Occupational health services are expected to respect workers’ right to privacy. Organizations are expected not to use workers' participation in such services and programs, or the health data derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding the employment or engagement of workers, including termination, demotion, promotion or offering of prospects, compensation, or any other favorable or unfavorable treatment. See reference [6] in the Bibliography.

# Disclosure 403-4 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information for employees and for workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:  

a. A description of the processes for worker participation and consultation in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the occupational health and safety management system, and for providing access to and communicating relevant information on occupational health and safety to workers.   
b. Where formal joint management-worker health and safety committees exist, a description of their responsibilities, meeting frequency, decision-making authority, and whether and, if so, why any workers are not represented by these committees.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.4 The reporting organization should report whether and, if so, which occupational health and safety topics are covered in local or global formal agreements with trade unions.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-4-a  

When describing the processes for worker participation in occupational health and safety, the reporting organization can include information on:  

formal participation, based on legal requirements;   
participation through engagement with formally recognized workers’ representatives;   
direct participation, particularly by affected workers (e.g., the direct involvement of all workers in occupational health and safety decisions in small organizations); the use of committees, and how these committees are established and operated; participation in the occupational health and safety management system (e.g., participation in identification of hazards, assessment of risks, application of the hierarchy of controls, investigation of incidents, audits, decision-making about the use of contractors and outsourcing); how obstacles to participation are identified and removed (e.g., by providing training, by protecting workers against reprisals).  

When describing the processes for providing access to and communicating relevant information on occupational health and safety to workers, the organization can report whether it provides information about work-related incidents and the actions taken in response.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-4-b  

A common form of worker participation in occupational health and safety is through joint management-worker health and safety committees. In addition to direct participation of workers from all job levels in these committees, workers’ representatives, where they exist, might also be involved in these joint activities, as they might be authorized to make decisions about occupational health and safety, among other workplace decisions.  

Where formal joint management-worker health and safety committees exist, the organization can also describe the level at which each committee operates within the organization, its dispute resolution mechanism, its chairing responsibilities, and how the committee members are protected against reprisals.  

Disclosure 403-4-b requires a description of whether and, if so, why any workers are not represented by these committees. It does not require information on which workers are or are not members of such committees.  

# Guidance for clause 1.4  

Agreements at the local level typically include topics such as provision of personal protective equipment; participation of workers’ representatives in health and safety inspections, audits, and incident investigations; provision of training and education; and protection against reprisals  

Agreements at the global level typically include topics such as compliance with the ILO’s International Labour Standards; arrangements or structures for resolving problems; and commitments regarding occupational health and safety standards and levels of performance.  

# Disclosure 403-5 Worker training on occupational health and safety  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information for employees and for workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:  

a. A description of any occupational health and safety training provided to workers, including generic training as well as training on specific work-related hazards, hazardous activities, or hazardous situations.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-5  

When describing the occupational health and safety training provided, the reporting organization can include information on:  

how training needs are assessed;   
how the training is designed and delivered, including the content or topics addressed, the competency of trainers, which workers receive the training, the frequency of the training, and whether the training is provided in a language easily understood by workers;   
whether the training is provided free of charge and during paid working hours – if not, whether it is mandatory for workers to attend, and whether they are compensated for this; how the effectiveness of the training is evaluated.  

# Disclosure 403-6 Promotion of worker health  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information for employees and for workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:  

a. An explanation of how the organization facilitates workers’ access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services, and the scope of access provided.   
b. A description of any voluntary health promotion services and programs offered to workers to address major non-work-related health risks, including the specific health risks addressed, and how the organization facilitates workers’ access to these services and programs.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

1.5 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

1.5.1 How the organization maintains the confidentiality of workers’ personal healthrelated information;   
1.5.2 How the organization ensures that workers’ personal health-related information and their participation in any services or programs is not used for any favorable or unfavorable treatment of workers.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-6-a  

Achieving universal health coverage, including financial risk protection; access to quality essential healthcare services; and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all, is one of the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Target 3.8).  

Workers’ access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services might be facilitated, for example, through company clinics or disease treatment programs, referral systems, or health insurance or financial contributions.  

When describing the scope of access to non- occupational medical and healthcare services provided, the reporting organization can specify the types of service to which access is facilitated and the types of worker that have access to them.  

If the organization does not facilitate workers’ access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services because it operates in a country where the population already has access to high-quality and accessible services (e.g., through financial or other support), the organization can state this in its reported information.  

If the organization does not facilitate access to non- occupational medical and healthcare services for workers who are not employees because the employer of those workers facilitates their access to these services, the organization can state this in its reported information.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-6-b  

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 3). This goal includes targets such as reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment, and promoting mental health and wellbeing; strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful consumption of alcohol; ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services; and ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, and combating hepatitis, water-borne diseases, and other communicable diseases.  

Disclosure 403-6-b covers voluntary services and programs aimed at addressing major nonwork-related health risks among workers, including both physical and mental health-related risks. Examples of these risks include smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, HIV, and psychosocial factors.  

Voluntary health promotion programs and services might include smoking cessation programs, dietary advice, offering of healthy food in the canteen, stress-reducing programs, provision of a gym, or fitness programs. A program or service is voluntary when it does not set mandatory  

personal targets, and if incentives are provided, these are not associated with the organization’s decisions regarding employment or engagement of workers.  

Voluntary health promotion services and programs complement but cannot be a substitute for occupational health and safety services, programs and systems that prevent harm and protect workers from work-related injuries and ill health. Voluntary health promotion and occupational health and safety may be managed jointly by the organization, as part of an overall approach to ensuring the health and safety of workers.  

When describing how it facilitates workers’ access to voluntary health promotion services and programs, the organization can explain whether it allows workers to make use of these during paid working hours. The organization can also report if these services and programs are available for family members of workers.  

When describing its voluntary health promotion services and programs, the organization can also report:  

how the topics covered in these services and programs are selected, including how workers are engaged in the selection of topics;   
the extent to which these services and programs include proven effective interventions (see reference [19] in the Bibliography);   
the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these services and programs;   
the approaches used to raise awareness about these services and programs and encourage participation.  

# Guidance for clauses 1.5.1 and 1.5.2  

Non-occupational health services and programs are expected to respect workers’ right to privacy. Organizations are expected not to use workers' participation in such services and programs, or the health data derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding the employment or engagement of workers, including termination, demotion, promotion or offering of prospects, compensation, or any other favorable or unfavorable treatment. See reference [6] in the Bibliography.

# Disclosure 403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. A description of the organization’s approach to preventing or mitigating significant negative occupational health and safety impacts that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships, and the related hazards and risks.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

In cases where an organization has no control over both the work and workplace, it still has a responsibility to make efforts, including exercising any leverage it might have, to prevent and mitigate negative occupational health and safety impacts that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships. For more guidance, see the Scope of ‘workers’ in this Standard section.

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 403-8 Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. If the organization has implemented an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines: i. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are covered by such a system; ii. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are covered by such a system that has been internally audited; iii. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are covered by such a system that has been audited or certified by an external party.   
b. Whether and, if so, why any workers have been excluded from this disclosure, including the types of worker excluded.   
c. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Occupational health and safety management systems can serve as an effective approach to managing and continually eliminating hazards and minimizing risks. It is a systems-based approach that seeks to integrate occupational health and safety management into overall business processes. A system typically moves through a ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle, promoting leadership and practice through meaningful consultation and participation of workers from all job levels in the organization.  

A systems-based approach, which encompasses fully integrated processes, can be a significant advancement over an approach that considers hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation as isolated activities. Focusing on system deficiencies can enable an organization to identify deficiencies in its overall management of occupational health and safety; address resources, policy, and operational controls; and ensure continual improvement.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-8  

This disclosure indicates what proportion of an organization’s employees, and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, are covered by an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines. The list of legal requirements and/ or recognized standards/guidelines used by the reporting organization in its occupational health and safety management system are reported using Disclosures 403-1-a-i and 403-1-a-ii in the Topic management disclosures section.  

If not all workers are covered by the occupational health and safety management system, the organization can report whether any of the workers not covered are at high risk of work-related injury or ill health.  

In addition to the information required by this disclosure, the organization can report the number and percentage of sites covered by an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines.  

The organization can also describe:  

the approach used for internal audits (e.g., whether they are carried out following an internally-developed audit standard or a recognized audit standard, what is the qualification  

of the auditors);   
whether any processes or functions have been excluded from the scope of the audit or certification, and how occupational health and safety performance is being monitored in those areas;   
the audit or certification standard used.  

Audits by external parties may include both second-party and third-party audits. Second-party audits are usually performed by customers or others on behalf of customers, or by any other external parties that have a formal interest in the organization. Third-party audits are performed by independent organizations such as registrars (i.e., certification bodies) or regulators.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-8-b  

Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours, permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole or shared control), and location, among others.  

# Disclosure 403-9 Work-related injuries  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. For all employees:  

i. The number and rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury;   
ii. The number and rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities);   
iii. The number and rate of recordable work-related injuries;   
iv. The main types of work-related injury;   
v. The number of hours worked.  

b. For all workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:  

i. The number and rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury;   
ii. The number and rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities);   
iii. The number and rate of recordable work-related injuries;   
iv. The main types of work-related injury;   
v. The number of hours worked.  

c. The work-related hazards that pose a risk of high-consequence injury, including:  

i. how these hazards have been determined;   
ii. which of these hazards have caused or contributed to high-consequence injuries during the reporting period;   
iii. actions taken or underway to eliminate these hazards and minimize risks using the hierarchy of controls.  

d. Any actions taken or underway to eliminate other work-related hazards and minimize risks using the hierarchy of controls.  

e. Whether the rates have been calculated based on 200,000 or 1,000,000 hours worked.  

f. Whether and, if so, why any workers have been excluded from this disclosure, including the types of worker excluded.  

g. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.  

# Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 403-9, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 exclude fatalities in the calculation of the number and rate of highconsequence work-related injuries;   
2.1.2 include fatalities as a result of work-related injury in the calculation of the number and rate of recordable work-related injuries;   
2.1.3 include injuries as a result of commuting incidents only where the transport has been organized by the organization;   
2.1.4 calculate the rates based on either 200,000 or 1,000,000 hours worked, using the following formulas:

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:  

2.2.1 If the numbers and rates reported are significantly higher for certain types of injury, countries, business lines, or workers’ demographics (e.g., sex, gender, migrant status, age, or worker type), a breakdown of these data;   
2.2.2 A breakdown of the number of recordable work-related injuries by type of incident;   
2.2.3 If chemical hazards have been identified in Disclosure 403-9-c, a list of the chemicals;   
2.2.4 The number of high-potential work-related incidents identified;   
2.2.5 The number of close calls identified.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-9  

This disclosure covers work-related injuries. Data on work-related injuries are a measure of the extent of harm suffered by workers; they are not a measure of safety.  

An increase in the number or rate of reported incidents does not necessarily mean that there have been a greater number of incidents than before; it can indicate an improvement in the recording and reporting of incidents.  

If an increase in the number or rate of reported incidents is the result of the organization’s actions to improve the reporting and recording of fatalities, injuries, and ill health, or its actions to expand the scope of its management system to cover more workers or workplaces, the reporting organization can explain this and report on these actions and their results.  

Types of work-related injury can include death, amputation of a limb, laceration, fracture, hernia, burns, loss of consciousness, and paralysis, among others.  

In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be reported using Disclosure 403-10. If the organization operates in a jurisdiction where worker compensation systems classify musculoskeletal disorders as injuries, the organization can explain this and report these disorders using Disclosure 403-9. See references [5] and [16] in the Bibliography for a list of musculoskeletal disorders.  

Injuries involving members of the public as a result of a work-related incident are not included in this disclosure, but the organization can report this information separately. For example, the organization can report incidents where a vehicle driven by a worker causes the deaths of other road users or incidents where visitors are injured during their visit to the organization’s workplace.  

# uidance for reporting on high-consequence work-related injuries  

As per the definition of recordable work-related injury, the organization is required to report all work-related injuries as part of the ‘number and rate of recordable work-related injuries’. In addition, the organization is required to separately report high-consequence work- related injuries, with a breakdown by:  

fatalities, to be reported using Disclosures 403-9-a-i and 403-9-b-i. other injuries from which the worker cannot recover (e.g., amputation of a limb), or does not or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within 6 months (e.g., fracture  

with complications), to be reported using Disclosures 403-9-a-ii and 403-9-b-ii.  

The definition of ‘high-consequence work-related injury’ uses ‘recovery time’, instead of ‘lost time’, as the criterion for determining the severity of an injury. Lost time is an indicator of the loss of productivity for an organization as a result of a work-related injury; it does not necessarily indicate the extent of harm suffered by a worker.  

‘Recovery time’, in contrast, refers to the time needed for a worker to recover fully to pre-injury health status; it does not refer to the time needed for a worker to return to work. In some cases, a worker might return to work before full recovery.  

In addition to reporting information on high-consequence work-related injuries based on recovery time as required by this disclosure, the organization can also report the number and rate of work-related injuries that resulted in lost-workday cases, the average number of lost days per lost-workday case, the number of lost workdays, and the absentee rate.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-c  

This disclosure covers work-related hazards that pose a risk of high-consequence injury if not controlled, even when there are control measures in place. The hazards might have been identified proactively through risk assessment, or reactively as a result of either a high-potential incident or a high-consequence injury.  

Examples of work-related hazards causing or contributing to high-consequence injuries include excessive workload demands, tripping hazards, or exposure to flammable materials.  

If the identified work-related hazards vary significantly across different locations, the organization may group or disaggregate these by relevant categories, such as by geographical area or business line. Similarly, if there are a high number of hazards, the organization may group or categorize them to facilitate reporting.  

When reporting how it has determined which work-related hazards pose a risk of highconsequence injury using Disclosure 403-9-c-i, the organization can describe the criteria or threshold used to determine which hazards pose such a risk and which do not. The processes to identify hazards and assess risks, and to apply the hierarchy of controls, are reported using Disclosure 403-2-a.  

Disclosure 403-9-c-ii does not require reporting which work-related hazards have caused or contributed to which high-consequence injuries during the reporting period; it requires the aggregate analysis of all work-related hazards that resulted in high-consequence injuries.  

If a work-related incident resulting in a high-consequence injury is still under investigation at the end of the reporting period, the organization can state this in its reported information. The organization can report on actions taken during the reporting period to eliminate hazards and minimize risks that were identified, or to address work-related incidents that took place, in prior reporting periods.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-d  

This disclosure covers any actions taken or underway to eliminate other work-related hazards and minimize risks (i.e., not covered in Disclosure 403-9-c) using the hierarchy of controls. This disclosure can include actions taken in response to non-high-consequence work-related injuries, and work-related incidents with low probability of causing high-consequence injuries.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-f  

Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours, permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole or shared control), and location, among others.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-g  

If the organization follows the ILO code of practice on Recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, it can state this in response to Disclosure 403-9-g.  

If the organization does not follow the ILO code of practice, it can indicate which system of rules it applies in recording and reporting work-related injuries and its relationship to the ILO code of practice.  

If the organization cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (e.g., paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its reported information.  

When the organization cannot directly calculate or estimate the number of hours worked (e.g., because the workers performed non-routine work during an emergency situation, or because the performed work was not paid for by the hour), it is required to provide a reason for this omission as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for requirements on reasons for omission.  

# Guidance for clause 2.1.3  

Clause 2.1.3 requires the organization to include injuries as a result of commuting incidents in cases where the transport has been organized by the organization (e.g., company or contracted bus or vehicle). The organization can report other commuting incidents separately; for example if this information is to be reported under local law.  

# Guidance for clause 2.1.4  

Clause 2.1.4 requires the organization to calculate the rates based on either 200,000 or 1,000,000 hours worked.  

Standardized rates allow for meaningful comparisons of statistics, for example between different periods or organizations, or help account for differences in the number of workers in the reference group and the number of hours worked by them.  

A rate based on 200,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 100 full-time workers over a one-year timeframe, based on the assumption that one full-time worker works 2,000 hours per year. For example, a rate of 1.0 means that, on average, there is one work-related injury for every group of 100 full-time workers over a one-year timeframe. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 fulltime workers over a one-year timeframe.  

A rate based on 200,000 hours worked might be more suitable for small organizations.  

In addition to standardized rates, this disclosure requires the organization to report absolute data (i.e., numbers), to allow information users to calculate the rates themselves using other methodologies if needed.  

# Guidance for clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2  

Target 8.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to ‘protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment’. Some groups might be at increased risk of work-related injury due to demographic factors such as sex, gender, migrant status, or age; it can thus be beneficial to break down data on work-related injuries by these demographic criteria. See reference [14] in the Bibliography.  

ILO Convention 143 ‘Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention’ defines ‘migrant worker’ as ‘a person who migrates or who has migrated from one country to another with a view to being employed otherwise than on his own account and includes any person regularly admitted as a migrant worker’. See ILO Convention 143 for more guidance.  

If the data on work-related injuries are driven primarily by certain types of injury (e.g., amputation, paralysis) or incident (e.g., explosion, road accident), the organization can provide a breakdown of this information.

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-10  

Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. They include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (e.g., noiseinduced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder). This disclosure covers, but is not limited to, the diseases included in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases. In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be reported using this disclosure. See references [5] and [16] in the Bibliography.  

This disclosure covers all cases of work-related ill health notified to the reporting organization or identified by the organization through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The organization might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected workers, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reporting period among former workers. If the organization determines, for example through investigation, that the notified case of work-related ill health is not due to exposure whilst working for the organization, it can explain  

this in its reported information.  

This disclosure covers both short-latency and long-latency work-related ill health. Latency refers to the time period between exposure and the onset of ill health.  

Many cases of long-latency work-related ill health go undetected; if detected, they might not necessarily be due to exposures with one employer. For example, a worker might be exposed to asbestos while working for different employers over time, or might suffer from a long-latency disease that turns fatal many years after the worker has left the organization. For this reason, data on work-related ill health are to be complemented with information on work-related hazards.  

In some situations, an organization might not be able to collect or publicly disclose data on work-related ill health. The following are examples of these situations:  

National or regional regulations, contractual obligations, health insurance provisions, and other legal requirements related to the privacy of workers’ health-related information, might prevent organizations from collecting, maintaining, and publicly reporting these data. The nature of information on workers’ exposure to psychosocial factors, largely based on self-disclosure and in many instances protected under healthcare privacy regulations, might limit organizations in disclosing this information.  

In these situations, the organization is required to provide a reason for omission of these data as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for requirements on reasons for omission.  

Cases of ill health involving members of the public as a result of a work-related incident are not included in this disclosure, but the organization can report this information separately. An example of such an incident is when a chemical substance spill causes ill health among members of a nearby community.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-c  

This disclosure includes exposures to the 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Group 1’ (carcinogenic to humans), ‘IARC Group 2A’ (probably carcinogenic to humans), and ‘IARC Group 2B’ (possibly carcinogenic to humans) agents. See references [17] and [18] in the Bibliography.  

See Guidance for Disclosure for 403-9-c for more information on reporting on hazards.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-d  

Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours, permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole or shared control), and location, among others.  

# Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-e  

If the organization follows the ILO code of practice on Recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, it can state this in response to Disclosure 403-10-e.  

If the organization does not follow the ILO code of practice, it can indicate which system of rules it applies in recording and reporting work-related ill health and its relationship to the ILO code of practice.  

# Guidance for clause 2.4.1  

If the data on work-related ill health are driven primarily by certain types of ill health or disease (e.g., respiratory diseases, skin diseases) or incident (e.g., exposure to bacteria or viruses), the organization can provide a breakdown of this information.

# hierarchy of controls  

systematic approach to enhance occupational health and safety, eliminate hazards, and minimize risks  

Note 1:  

The hierarchy of controls seeks to protect workers by ranking the ways in which hazards can be controlled. Each control in the hierarchy is considered less effective than the one before it. The priority is to eliminate the hazard, which is the most effective way to control it.  

Note 2: The International Labour Organization (ILO) Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, 2001 and ISO 45001:2018 list the following preventive and protective measures in the following order of priority:  

eliminate the hazard/risk;   
substitute the hazard/risk with less hazardous processes, operations,   
materials, or equipment;   
control the hazard/risk at source, through the use of engineering controls or organizational measures;   
minimize the hazard/risk by the design of safe work systems, which include administrative control measures;   
where residual hazards/risks cannot be controlled by collective measures, provide for appropriate personal protective equipment, including clothing, at no cost, and implement measures to ensure its use and maintenance.  

# high-consequence work-related injury

# worker consultation  

seeking of workers’ views before making a decision  

Note 1: Worker consultation might be carried out through workers’ representatives.  

Note 2:  

Consultation is a formal process, whereby management takes the views of workers into account when making a decision. Therefore, consultation needs to take place before the decision is made. It is essential to provide timely information to workers or their representatives in order for them to provide meaningful and effective input before decisions are made. Genuine consultation involves dialogue.  

Note 3:  

Worker participation and worker consultation are two distinct terms with specific meanings. See definition of ‘worker participation’.

# work-related injury or ill health  

negative impacts on health arising from exposure to hazards at work  

Source:  

International Labour Organization (ILO), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, ILO-OSH 2001, 2001; modified  

Note 1:  

‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and disorders. The terms ‘disease’, ‘illness’, and ‘disorder’ are often used interchangeably and refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses.  

# Note 2:  

Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at work. Other types of incident can occur that are not connected with the work itself. For example, the following incidents are not considered to be work related:  

a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that is unconnected with work; a worker driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (where driving is not part of the work, and where the transport has not been organized by the employer); a worker with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is unconnected with work.  

# Note 3:  

Traveling for work: Injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is traveling are work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work activities ‘in the interest of the employer’. Examples of such activities include traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer).  

Working at home: Injuries and ill health that occur when working at home are work related if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work at home, and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than the general home environment or setting.  

Mental illness: A mental illness is considered to be work related if it has been notified voluntarily by the worker and is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience stating that the illness is work related.  

For more guidance on determining ‘work-relatedness’, see the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Determination of work-relatedness 1904.5, https://www.osha.gov/pls/ oshaweb/owadisp.show_document? p_table $\O=$ STANDARDS&p_id $=9636$ , accessed on 1 June 2018.

# Introduction  

GRI 404: Training and Education 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their training and education-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of training and education. This includes an organization’s approach to training and upgrading employee skills, and performance and career development reviews. It also includes transition assistance programs to facilitate continued employability, and the management of career endings due to retirement or termination.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/3ae41f74a6c7be153a0f7eb6251c7ac26253639bf62559a09d02a462a23dd346.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its training and education-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined training and education to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s training and education-related impacts (Disclosure 404-1 through Disclosure 404-3).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined training and education to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages training and education using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Average hours of training that the organization’s employees have undertaken during the reporting period, by:  

i. gender;   
ii. employee category.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 404-1, the reporting organization should:  

2.1.1 express employee numbers as either head count or full-time equivalent (FTE), and disclose and apply the approach consistently in the period, and between periods;   
2.1.2 use data from Disclosure 2-7 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of employees;   
2.1.3 draw from the information used for Disclosure 405-1 in GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016 to identify the total number of employees by employee category.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 404-1  

This disclosure provides insight into the scale of an  organization’s investment in training, and the degree to which the investment is made across the entire employee base.  

In the context of this Standard, ‘training’ refers to:  

all types of vocational training and instruction;   
paid educational leave provided by an organization for its employees;   
training or education pursued externally and paid for in whole or in part by an organization;   
training on specific topics.  

Training does not include on-site coaching by supervisors.  

To calculate the information in Disclosure 404-1, the reporting organization can use the following formulas:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="3">Average training hours per employee</td><td rowspan="3">=</td><td>Total number of training hours provided to employees</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of employees</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average training hours per</td><td>Total number of training hours provided to female employees</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>female</td><td>=</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Total number of female employees</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Average training hours per male =</td><td>Total number of training hours provided to male employees</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of male employees</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total number of training hours provided to each category of employees</td></tr><tr><td>everagetrainighgurs per 二</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total number of employees in category</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A number of calculations can be undertaken to report on employee categories. These calculations are specific to each organization.  

# Disclosure 404-2 Programs for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programs  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Type and scope of programs implemented and assistance provided to upgrade employee skills.   
b. Transition assistance programs provided to facilitate continued employability and the management of career endings resulting from retirement or termination of employment.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 404-2  

Employee training programs that aim to upgrade skills can include:  

internal training courses;   
funding support for external training or education;   
the provision of sabbatical periods with guaranteed return to employment.  

Transition assistance programs provided to support employees who are retiring or who have been terminated can include:  

pre-retirement planning for intended retirees;   
retraining for those intending to continue working;   
severance pay, which can take into account employee age and years of service;   
job placement services;   
assistance (such as training, counselling) on transitioning to a non-working life.  

# Background  

Programs for upgrading employee skills allow an organization to plan skills acquisition that equips employees to meet strategic targets in a changing work environment. More skilled employees enhance the organization’s human capital and contribute to employee satisfaction, which correlates strongly with  improved performance. For those facing retirement, confidence and quality of work relations is improved  by the knowledge that they are supported in their transition from work to retirement.  

# Disclosure 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of total employees by gender and by employee category who received a regular performance and career development review during the reporting period.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 404-3, the reporting organization should:  

2.2.1 use data from Disclosure 2-7 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of employees;   
2.2.2 draw from the information used for Disclosure 405-1 in GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016 to identify the total number of employees by employee category.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

This disclosure measures the extent to which an organization regularly appraises employee performance. This aids the personal development of individual employees. It also contributes to skills management and to the development of human capital within the organization. This disclosure also demonstrates the extent to which this system is applied throughout the organization, and whether there is inequity of access to these opportunities.  

Regular performance and career development reviews can also enhance employee satisfaction, which correlates with improved organizational performance. This disclosure helps demonstrate how an organization works to monitor and maintain the skill sets of its employees. When reported in conjunction with Disclosure 404-2, the disclosure also helps to illustrate how the organization approaches skills enhancement.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.

# Introduction  

GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to diversity and equal opportunity at work, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to diversity and equal opportunity at work.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s impacts related to diversity and equal opportunity at work.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of an organization’s approach to diversity and equal opportunity at work.  

When an organization actively promotes diversity and equality at work, it can generate significant benefits for both the organization and workers. For example, the organization can gain access to a larger and more diverse set of potential workers. These benefits also flow through to society in general, as greater equality promotes social stability and supports further economic development.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/8dd03a337194041e4108c62d1c00b6734c0139e04bb1d4887b04e79b807207c7.jpg)

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to diversity and equal opportunity at work. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 404: Training and Education 2016 and GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined diversity and equal opportunity to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s impacts related to diversity and equal opportunity at work (Disclosure 405-1 through Disclosure 405-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the  

information has been published).  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined diversity and equal opportunity to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages diversity and equal opportunity using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also describe the legal and socioeconomic environment that provides opportunities for, and barriers to, gender equity.  

This can include the share of female workers performing the organization’s activities, their equal remuneration, and their participation at the highest governance level.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of individuals within the organization’s governance bodies in each of the following diversity categories:  

i. Gender;   
ii. Age group: under 30 years old, 30-50 years old, over 50 years old;   
iii. Other indicators of diversity where relevant (such as minority or vulnerable groups).  

b. Percentage of employees per employee category in each of the following diversity categories:  

i. Gender;   
ii. Age group: under 30 years old, 30-50 years old, over 50 years old;   
iii. Other indicators of diversity where relevant (such as minority or vulnerable groups).  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 405-1, the reporting organization should use data from Disclosure 2-7 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of employees.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 405-1  

Examples of governance bodies that exist within an organization can be the board of directors, management committee, or a similar body for a non-corporate organization.  

An organization can identify any other indicators of diversity used in its own monitoring and recording that are relevant for reporting.  

# Background  

This disclosure provides a quantitative measure of diversity within an organization and can be used in conjunction with sectoral or regional benchmarks. Comparisons between broad employee diversity and management team diversity offer information on equal opportunity. Information reported in this disclosure also helps in assessing which issues can be of particular relevance to certain segments of the governance bodies or employees.  

# Disclosure 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

a. Ratio of the basic salary and remuneration of women to men for each employee category, by significant locations of operation.   
b. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.   
2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 405-2, the reporting organization should base remuneration on the average pay of each gender grouping within each employee category.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 405-2  

The reporting organization can draw from the information used for Disclosure 405-1 to identify the total number of employees in each employee category by gender.  

# Background  

An organization can take an active role in reviewing its operations and decisions, in order to promote diversity, eliminate gender bias, and support equal opportunity. These principles apply equally to recruitment, opportunities for advancement, and remuneration policies. Equality of remuneration is also an important factor in retaining qualified employees.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Introduction  

GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to discrimination, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its discrimination-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s discrimination-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of non-discrimination.  

For the purpose of this Standard, discrimination is defined as the act and the result of treating people unequally by imposing unequal burdens or denying benefits, instead of treating each person fairly on the basis of individual merit. Discrimination can also include harassment. This is defined as a course of comments or actions that are unwelcome, or should reasonably be known to be unwelcome, to the person towards whom they are addressed.  

An organization is expected to avoid discriminating against any person on any grounds, including avoiding discrimination against workers at work. It is also expected to avoid discriminating against customers with respect to the provision of products and services, or against any other stakeholder, including suppliers or business partners.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations (UN): see the Bibliography.  

A number of international conventions and declarations address discrimination against specific groups of people or on specific grounds. Examples include the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation  

to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/6b869d04a7bf88efd5909ab8258637f42908b3f1ce7fc85d195ab5c279aeeb45.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to discrimination.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined non-discrimination to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s discrimination-related impacts (Disclosure 406-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this  

information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined non-discrimination to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages non-discrimination using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of incidents of discrimination during the reporting period. b. Status of the incidents and actions taken with reference to the following:  

i. Incident reviewed by the organization;   
ii. Remediation plans being implemented;   
iii. Remediation plans that have been implemented, with results reviewed through routine internal management review processes;   
iv. Incident no longer subject to action.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 406-1, the reporting organization shall include incidents of discrimination on grounds of race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin as defined by the ILO, or other relevant forms of discrimination involving internal and/or external stakeholders across operations in the reporting period.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 406-1  

In the context of this disclosure, an ‘incident’ refers to a legal action or complaint registered with the reporting organization or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-compliance identified by the organization through established procedures. Established procedures to identify instances of non-compliance can include management system audits, formal monitoring programs, or grievance mechanisms.  

An incident is no longer subject to action if it is resolved, the case is completed, or no further action is required by the organization. For example, an incident for which no further action is required can include cases that were withdrawn or where the underlying circumstances that led to the incident no longer exist.  

# Background  

According to ILO instruments, discrimination can occur on the grounds of race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, and social origin. Discrimination can also occur based on factors such as age, disability, migrant status, HIV and AIDS, gender, sexual orientation, genetic predisposition, and lifestyles, among others.1  

The presence and effective implementation of policies to avoid discrimination are a basic expectation of responsible business conduct.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.  

# D  

# discrimination

# Introduction  

GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of freedom of association and collective bargaining.  

Freedom of association is a human right as defined by international declarations and conventions. In this context, freedom of association refers to the right of employers and workers to form, to join and to run their own organizations without prior authorization or interference by the state or any other entity.  

The right of workers to collectively bargain the terms and conditions of work is also an internationally recognized human right. Collective bargaining refers to all negotiations that take place between one or more employers or employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions), on the other, for determining working conditions and terms of employment or for regulating relations between employers and workers.1  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining. In addition to this Standard, Disclosure 2-30 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires reporting on the percentage of total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined freedom of association and collective bargaining to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining (Disclosure 407-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this  

information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

Requirements, guidance and defined terms The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined freedom of association and collective bargaining to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages freedom of association and collective bargaining using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2 The reporting organization should describe any policy or policies considered likely to affect workers’ decisions to form or join a trade union, to bargain collectively or to engage in trade union activities.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 407-1 Operations and suppliers in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining may be at risk  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Operations and suppliers in which workers’ rights to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be violated or at significant risk either in terms of: i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier; ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.   
b. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to support rights to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 407-1  

The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 407-1, can reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw from recognized international data sources, such as the various outcomes of the ILO Supervisory bodies and the recommendations of the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association (see reference [4] in the Bibliography).  

When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for further guidance.  

# Background  

This disclosure concerns an organization’s due diligence with respect to any negative impacts its activities have had on the human rights of workers to form or join trade unions and to bargain collectively. This can include policies and processes with respect to the organization's business relationships, including its suppliers. It can also include the due diligence process to identify operations and suppliers where these rights are at risk.  

It also aims to reveal actions that have been taken to support these rights across an organization’s range of operations. This disclosure does not require the organization to express a specific opinion on the quality of national legal systems.  

Collective agreements can be made at the level of the organization, at the level of a particular site, at the industry level, and at the national level in countries where this is the practice. Collective agreements can cover specific groups of workers, for example, those performing a specific activity or working at a specific location.  

An organization is expected to respect the rights of workers to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. It is also expected to not benefit from or contribute to such violations through its business relationships (e.g., suppliers).

# Introduction  

GRI 408: Child Labor 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to child labor, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to child labor.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to child labor.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of child labor. Abolishing child labor is a key principle and objective of major human rights instruments and legislation, and is the subject of national legislation in almost all countries.  

Child labor is work that ‘deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development including by interfering with their education. Specifically, it means types of work that are not permitted for children below the relevant minimum age.’1  

Child labor does not refer to youth employment or to children working. It refers to a universally-recognized human rights abuse. The internationally-agreed understanding of the meaning of child labor is set out in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 138 ‘Minimum Age Convention’.  

The minimum age for hazardous work is 18 years for all countries. Hazardous child labor is defined by Article 3 (d) of ILO Convention 182 ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’ as ‘work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.’  

Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent the use of child labor in its activities. It is also expected to avoid contributing to, or becoming complicit in, the use of child labor through its relationships with others (e.g., suppliers, clients).  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the ILO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to  

report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/4cff62a689459bd3d9ddc4f23eeaf5a331764c62a7346bad34a1c6a2752fe619.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to child labor.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined child labor to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to child labor (Disclosure 408-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined child labor to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages child labor using Disclosure 3- 3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labor  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of:  

i. child labor; ii. young workers exposed to hazardous work.   
b. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of child labor either in terms of: i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier; ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.   
c. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 408-1  

The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 408-1, can reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw from recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information and reports on the application of Conventions and Recommendations (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).  

When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for further guidance.  

In the context of the GRI Standards, a ‘young worker’ is defined as a person above the applicable minimum working age and younger than 18 years of age. Note that Disclosure 408-1 does not require quantitative reporting on child labor or the number of young workers. Rather, it asks for reporting on the operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of child labor or young workers exposed to hazardous work.  

# Background  

Child labor is subject to ILO Conventions 138 ‘Minimum Age Convention’ (ILO Convention 138) and 182 ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’ (ILO Convention 182).  

‘Child labor’ refers to an abuse, which is not to be confused with ‘children working’ or with ‘young persons working’, which may not be abuses as stipulated in ILO Convention 138.  

The minimum age for working differs by country. ILO Convention 138 specifies a minimum age of 15 years or the age of completion of compulsory schooling (whichever is higher). However, there is an exception for certain countries where economies and educational facilities are insufficiently developed and a minimum age of 14 years might apply. These countries of exception are specified by the ILO in response to special application by the country concerned, and in consultation with representative organizations of employers and workers.  

ILO Convention 138 stipulates that ‘national laws or regulations may permit the employment or work of persons 13 to 15 years of age on light work which is (a) not likely to be harmful to their health or development; and (b) not such as to prejudice their attendance at school, their participation in vocational orientation or training programmes approved by the competent authority or their capacity to benefit from the instruction received’.  

While child labor takes many different forms, a priority is to eliminate without delay the worst forms of child labor as defined by Article 3 of ILO Convention This includes all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery (such as sale, trafficking, forced or compulsory labor, serfdom,  

recruitment for armed conflict); the use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution or illicit activities and any work that is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children. ILO Convention 182 is intended to set priorities for states; however, organizations are expected not to use this convention to justify forms of child labor.  

Child labor results in under-skilled and unhealthy workers for tomorrow and perpetuates poverty across generations, thus impeding sustainable development. The abolition of child labor is therefore necessary for both economic and human development.

# Introduction  

GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to forced or compulsory labor, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to forced or compulsory labor.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to forced or compulsory labor.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of forced or compulsory labor  

Not to be subjected to forced or compulsory labor is a fundamental human right. According to International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 29 ‘Forced Labour Convention’, forced or compulsory labor is defined as ‘all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.'1  

Forced and compulsory labor affects all world regions, countries, and economic sectors, and includes workers in both formal and informal employment.2  

Some of the most common forms of forced labor include forced labor in prisons (except for prisoners that have been convicted in a court of law, and whose labor is under the supervision and control of a public authority), human trafficking for the purpose of forced labor, coercion in employment, forced labor linked to exploitative labor contract systems, and debt-induced forced labor, also known as ‘debt-bondage’ or ‘bonded labor’.3  

The victims are most likely from groups subject to discrimination or performing work on an informal or precarious basis. This can include women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage, and sweatshop or farm workers, among other groups.4  

Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent and combat all forms of forced or compulsory labor in its activities. It is also expected to avoid contributing to or becoming linked to the use of forced or compulsory labor through its relationships with others (e.g., suppliers, clients).  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the ILO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/b9b9b586322212dba251f2549a03fabb9a1a0c3e3a4bac6c954148e07a9a043b.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to forced or compulsory labor. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 408: Child Labor 2016.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined forced or compulsory labor to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to forced or compulsory labor (Disclosure 409-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined forced or compulsory labor to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages forced or compulsory labor using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor either in terms of: i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier; ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.   
b. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 409-1  

The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 409-1, can reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw from recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information and reports on the application of Conventions and Recommendations (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).  

When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for further guidance.  

# Background  

Forced or compulsory labor exists globally in a variety of forms. The most extreme examples are slave labor and bonded labor, but debts can also be used as a means of maintaining workers in a state of forced labor. Indicators of forced labor can also include withholding identity papers, requiring compulsory deposits, and compelling workers, under threat of firing, to work extra hours to which they have not previously agreed.  

Eliminating forced labor remains an important challenge. Forced labor is not only a serious violation of a fundamental human right, it also perpetuates poverty and is a hindrance to economic and human development.5  

The presence and effective implementation of policies for eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labor are a basic expectation of responsible business conduct. Organizations with multinational operations are required by law in some countries to provide information on their efforts to eradicate forced labor in their supply chains.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of security practices. It focuses on the conduct of security personnel towards third parties, and the potential risk for excessive use of force or other violations of human rights. Security personnel can refer to employees of the reporting organization or employees of third-party organizations that provide security forces.  

The use of security personnel can have negative impacts on local populations, and on the upholding of human rights and the rule of law. Providing effective training in human rights therefore helps to make sure that security personnel understand when to use force in an appropriate way, and how to ensure respect for human rights.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its security practice-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined security practices to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s security practice-related impacts (Disclosure 410-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined security practices to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages security practices using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 410-1 Security personnel trained in human rights policies or procedures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

a. Percentage of security personnel who have received formal training in the organization’s human rights policies or specific procedures and their application to security.   
b. Whether training requirements also apply to third-party organizations providing securit personnel.   
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 410-1-a, the reporting organization should: 2.1.1 calculate the percentage using the total number of security personnel, whether they are employees of the organization or employees of third-party organizations; 2.1.2 state whether employees of third-party organizations are also included in the calculation.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 410-1  

The training can refer either to training dedicated to the subject of human rights or to a human rights module within a general training program. Training can cover issues such as the use of force, inhuman or degrading treatment or discrimination, or identification and registering.  

# Background  

The use of security personnel can play an essential role in allowing an organization to operate in a safe and productive manner, and can contribute to the security of local communities and populations.  

However, as set out in the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers, the use of security personnel can also have negative impacts on local populations and on the upholding of human rights and the rule of law.  

According to the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, ‘human rights education constitutes an essential contribution to the long-term prevention of human rights abuses and represents an important investment in the endeavor to achieve a just society in which all human rights of all persons are valued and respected.1  

Training security personnel in human rights can therefore help to ensure their appropriate conduct towards third parties, particularly regarding the use of force. This disclosure indicates the proportion of the security force that can reasonably be assumed to be aware of an organization’s expectations of human rights performance. Information provided under this disclosure can demonstrate the extent to which management systems pertaining to human rights are implemented.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Introduction  

GRI 411: Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples.   
Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the rights of indigenous peoples. While there is no universal definition of indigenous peoples, they are generally identified as:  

tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.  

Many indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices and therefore are considered a vulnerable group. Such a group could experience negative impacts as a result of the organization’s activities more severely than the general population.2  

In addition to their collective rights, each person belonging to indigenous peoples shares universal human rights.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/d204b358b67bb63fa42506e34343f6f4963c98e80c514d2ed2f7612a9b1a2d55.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has   
determined the rights of indigenous peoples to be a material topic:   
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples (Disclosure 411-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined the rights of indigenous peoples to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# 1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages the rights of indigenous peoples using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the International Labour Organization Convention 169 ‘Indigenous and Tribal Peoples’ address the rights of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples have both collective and individual rights, as set out in these instruments.  

The collective rights of indigenous peoples include, for example, the right to retain their own customs and institutions, and the right to self-determination. According to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the right to self-determination enables indigenous peoples to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’ and have the right to ‘autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions.’  

Indigenous peoples also have the right to occupy and use their lands or territories, including those who hold or use land pursuant to informal or customary rights. Indigenous peoples cannot be relocated without free, prior, and informed consent. They also have the right to redress in cases where their lands or resources have been occupied or damaged without their free, prior, and informed consent.  

Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to avoid infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples through its activities. An organization is also expected to respect the rights of indigenous peoples to free, prior, and informed consent in certain matters affecting them. This is the case when, for example, an organization intends to start operations on land that is inhabited or owned by indigenous peoples.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 411-1 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of identified incidents of violations involving the rights of indigenous peoples during the reporting period. b. Status of the incidents and actions taken with reference to the following:  

i. Incident reviewed by the organization;   
ii. Remediation plans being implemented;   
iii. Remediation plans that have been implemented, with results reviewed through routine internal management review processes;   
iv. Incident no longer subject to action.  

# RECOMMENDATIO  

NS 2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 411-1, the reporting organization should include incidents involving the rights of indigenous peoples among:  

2.1.1 workers performing the organization’s activities;   
2.1.2 communities likely to be affected by existing or planned activities of the organization.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 411-1  

In the context of this disclosure, an ‘incident’ refers to a legal action or complaint registered with the reporting organization or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-compliance identified by the organization through established procedures. Established procedures to identify instances of non-compliance can include management system audits, formal monitoring programs, or grievance mechanisms.  

# Background  

The number of recorded incidents involving the rights of indigenous peoples provides information about the implementation of an organization’s policies relating to indigenous peoples. This information helps to indicate the state of relations with stakeholder communities. This is particularly important in regions where indigenous peoples reside, or have interests near operations of the organization.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Introduction  

GRI 413: Local Communities 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to local communities, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts related to local communities.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s impacts related to local communities.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of local communities. In the GRI Standards, local communities are defined as individuals or groups of individuals living or working in areas that are affected or that could be affected by the organization’s activities. The local community can range from those living adjacent to the organization's operations to those living at a distance.  

An organization’s activities and infrastructure can have significant economic, social, cultural, and/or environmental impacts on local communities. Where possible, organizations are expected to anticipate and avoid negative impacts on local communities. Establishing a timely and effective stakeholder identification and engagement process is important to help organizations understand the vulnerability of local communities and how these might be affected by the organization’s activities.  

Due to the heterogeneous nature of local communities, an organization is expected to consider the differentiated nature of communities and the distinct and specific vulnerabilities these groups can suffer as a result of the organization’s activities.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/5a0f3e415bd2da02dfbcd437f7326834ace9f3d2e6f453102bf03da96f749256.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to local communities.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined local communities to be a material topic:  

• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s impacts related to local communities (Disclosure 413-1 through Disclosure 413-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined local communities to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages local communities using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also describe:  

the means by which stakeholders are identified and engaged with;   
which vulnerable groups have been identified;   
any collective or individual rights that have been identified that are of particular concern for the community in question;   
how it engages with stakeholder groups that are particular to the community (for example, groups defined by age, indigenous background, ethnicity or migration status);   
the means by which its departments and other bodies address risks and impacts, or support independent third parties to engage with stakeholders and address risks and impacts.  

# Background  

Communities have individual and collective rights deriving from, among others, international declarations and conventions such as:  

the United Nations (UN) Declaration, ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’, 1948;   
the United Nations (UN) Convention, ‘International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’, 1966;   
the United Nations (UN) Convention, ‘International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights’, 1966;   
the United Nations (UN) Declaration, ‘Declaration on the Right to Development’, 1986.  

Other standards such as the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Performance Standards (PS) also provide widely-accepted good practice approaches for organizational assessment, engagement and treatment of community-related impact issues (see IFC PS1 – Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts, and PS4 – Community Health, Safety, and Security).  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

Disclosure 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and/or development programs, including the use of:  

i. social impact assessments, including gender impact assessments, based on participatory processes;   
ii. environmental impact assessments and ongoing monitoring;   
iii. public disclosure of results of environmental and social impact assessments;   
iv. local community development programs based on local communities’ needs;   
v. stakeholder engagement plans based on stakeholder mapping;   
vi. broad based local community consultation committees and processes that include vulnerable groups;   
vii. works councils, occupational health and safety committees and other worker representation bodies to deal with impacts;   
viii. formal local community grievance processes.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 413-1, the reporting organization should use the data from Disclosure 2-6 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the total number of operations, if the organization has reported its total number of operations when describing its activities.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

A key element in managing impacts on people in local communities is assessment and planning in order to understand the actual and potential impacts, and strong engagement with local communities to understand their expectations and needs. There are many elements that can be incorporated into local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs. This disclosure seeks to identify which elements have been consistently applied, organization-wide.  

Where possible, organizations are expected to anticipate and avoid negative impacts on local communities. Where this is not possible, or where residual impacts remain, organizations are expected to manage those impacts appropriately, including grievances, and to compensate local communities for negative impacts.  

Establishing a timely and effective stakeholder identification and engagement process is important to help organizations understand the vulnerability of local communities and how these might be affected by the organization’s activities. A stakeholder engagement process both in early planning stages as well as during operations, can help establish lines of communication between an organization’s various departments (planning, finance, environment, production, etc.) and key stakeholder interest groups in the community. This enables an organization to consider the views of community stakeholders in its decisions, and to address its potential impacts on local communities in a timely manner.  

Organizations can utilize a number of useful tools to engage communities, including social and human rights impact assessments, which include a diverse set of approaches for proper identification of stakeholders and community characteristics. These can be based on issues such as ethnic background, indigenous descent, gender, age, migrant status, socioeconomic status, literacy levels, disabilities, income level, infrastructure availability or specific human health vulnerabilities which may exist within stakeholder communities.  

An organization is expected to consider the differentiated nature of local communities and to take specific action to identify and engage vulnerable groups. This might require adopting differentiated measures to allow the effective participation of vulnerable groups, such as making information available in alternate languages or format for those who are not literate or who do not have access to printed materials. Where necessary, organizations are expected to establish additional or separate processes so that negative impacts on vulnerable or disadvantaged groups are avoided, minimized, mitigated or compensated.1  

# Disclosure 413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities, including: i. the location of the operations; ii. the significant actual and potential negative impacts of operations.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 413-2, the reporting organization should:  

2.2.1 report the vulnerability and risk to local communities from potential negative impacts due to factors including: 2.2.1.1 the degree of physical or economic isolation of the local community; 2.2.1.2 the level of socioeconomic development, including the degree of gender equality within the community; 2.2.1.3 the state of socioeconomic infrastructure, including health and education infrastructure; 2.2.1.4 the proximity to operations; 2.2.1.5 the level of social organization; 2.2.1.6 the strength and quality of the governance of local and national institutions around local communities;  

2.2.2 report the exposure of the local community to its operations due to higher than average use of shared resources or impact on shared resources, including:  

2.2.2.1 the use of hazardous substances that have an impact on the environment and human health in general, and specifically have an impact on reproductive health; 2.2.2.2 the volume and type of pollution released; 2.2.2.3 the status as major employer in the local community; 2.2.2.4 land conversion and resettlement; 2.2.2.5 natural resource consumption; 2.2.3 for each of the significant actual and potential negative economic, social, cultural, and/or environmental impacts on local communities and their rights, describe: 2.2.3.1 the intensity or severity of the impact; 2.2.3.2 the likely duration of the impact; 2.2.3.3 the reversibility of the impact; 2.2.3.4 the scale of the impact.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 413-2  

Internal sources of information about actual and potential negative impacts of operations on local communities can include:  

actual performance data;   
internal investment plans and associated risk assessments;   
all data collected with topic disclosures as they relate to individual communities. For example: GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016, GRI 301: Materials 2016, GRI 302: Energy 2016, GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, GRI 304: Biodiversity 2016, GRI 305: Emissions 2016, GRI 306: Waste 2020, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI 408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016, GRI 410: Security Practices 2016, GRI 411: Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2016, and GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety 2016.  

# Background  

This disclosure is focused on significant actual and potential negative impacts related to an organization’s operations and not on community investments or donations, which are addressed by GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016.  

This disclosure informs stakeholders about an organization’s awareness of its negative impacts on local communities. It also enables the organization to better prioritize and improve  

its organization-wide attention to local communities.

# Introduction  

GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their social impacts in their supply chain, and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on its approach to preventing and mitigating negative social impacts in its supply chain.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its social impacts in its supply chain.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s supplier assessment and social impacts in its supply chain.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of supplier social assessment.  

An organization may be involved with negative social impacts either through its own activities or as a result of its business relationships with other parties. Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent, mitigate, and address actual and potential negative social impacts in the supply chain. These include negative impacts the organization either causes or contributes to, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the United Nations: see the Bibliography.  

Suppliers can be assessed for a range of social criteria, including human rights (such as child labor and forced or compulsory labor); employment practices; health and safety practices; industrial relations; incidents (such as of abuse, coercion or harassment); wages and compensation; and working hours. Some of these criteria are covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI 408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation  

to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.  

![](images/6b57e2120cd46626ca4bf949e2ac6bce156408258647259b99700367c01e1f71.jpg)  
Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its social impacts in its supply chain. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment 2016.  

If the reporting organization has determined both supplier social assessment and supplier environmental assessment to be material, it can combine its disclosures for GRI 308 and GRI 414. For example, if the organization uses the same approach for managing both topics, it can provide one combined explanation of how the organization manages both topics.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined supplier social assessment to be a material topic:  

• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s social impacts in its supply chain (Disclosure 414-1 through Disclosure 414-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The  

disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined supplier social assessment to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages supplier social assessment using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also disclose:  

the systems used to screen new suppliers using social criteria, and a list of the social criteria used to screen new suppliers;   
processes used, such as due diligence, to identify and assess significant actual and   
potential negative social impacts in the supply chain;   
how the organization identifies and prioritizes suppliers for assessment of social impacts;   
actions taken to address the significant actual and potential negative social impacts   
identified in the supply chain and whether the actions are intended to prevent, mitigate, or   
remediate the impacts;   
how expectations are established and defined in contracts with suppliers to promote the prevention, mitigation, and remediation of significant actual and potential negative social   
impacts, including targets and objectives;   
whether suppliers are incentivized and rewarded for the prevention, mitigation, and   
remediation of significant actual and potential negative social impacts;   
practices for assessing and auditing suppliers and their products and services using social   
criteria;   
a list of the type, system, scope, frequency, current implementation of assessment and audit   
and which parts of the supply chain have been certified and audited;   
the systems in place to assess the potential negative impacts of terminating a relationship with a supplier as a result of assessing the supplier for social impacts, and the organization’s strategy to mitigate those impacts.  

Social criteria or assessments of suppliers for social impacts can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI 408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).  

Negative impacts can include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.  

Assessments can be informed by audits, contractual reviews, two-way engagement, and complaint and grievance mechanisms.  

Actions taken to address social impacts can include changing an organization’s procurement practices, adjusting performance expectations, capacity building, training, changes to processes, as well as terminating supplier relationships.  

Assessments and audits of suppliers and their products and services using social criteria can be undertaken by an organization, by a second party, or by a third party.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# Disclosure 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social criteria  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using social criteria.  

# GUIDANCE  

Guidance for Disclosure 414-1   
Social criteria can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI 408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).  

# Background  

This disclosure informs stakeholders about the percentage of suppliers selected or contracted subject to due diligence processes for social impacts.  

An organization is expected to initiate due diligence as early as possible in the development of a new relationship with a supplier.  

Impacts may be prevented or mitigated at the stage of structuring contracts or other agreements, as well as via ongoing collaboration with suppliers.  

# Disclosure 414-2 Negative social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Number of suppliers assessed for social impacts. b. Number of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative social impacts. c. Significant actual and potential negative social impacts identified in the supply chain. d. Percentage of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative social impacts with which improvements were agreed upon as a result of assessment. e. Percentage of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative social impacts with which relationships were terminated as a result of assessment, and why. NS 2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 414-2, the reporting organization should, where it provides appropriate context on significant impacts, provide a breakdown of the information by:  

# RECOMMENDATIO  

2.1.1 the location of the supplier;   
2.1.2 the significant actual and potential negative social impact.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 414-2  

Negative impacts include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.

# Introduction  

GRI 415: Public Policy 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their public policyrelated impacts, and how they manage these impacts.  

The Standard is structured as follows:  

Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its public policy-related impacts.   
Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provides information about the organization’s public policy-related impacts.   
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.   
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.  

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of public policy. This includes an organization’s participation in the development of public policy, through activities such as lobbying and making financial or in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians, or causes.  

While an organization can positively support the public political process and encourage the development of public policy that benefits society at large, this can also bring risks associated with corruption, bribery, and undue influence, among others.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its public policy-related impacts.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined public policy to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s public policy-related impacts (Disclosure 415-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined public policy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1  

The reporting organization shall report how it manages public policy using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# RECOMMENDATIONS  

2 The reporting organization should report:  

1.2.1 the significant issues that are the focus of its participation in public policy development and lobbying;   
1.2.2 its stance on these issues, and any differences between its lobbying positions and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 415-1 Political contributions  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total monetary value of financial and in-kind political contributions made directly and indirectly by the organization by country and recipient/beneficiary. If applicable, how the monetary value of in-kind contributions was estimated.  

# GUIDANCE  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 415-1, the reporting organization shall calculate financial political contributions in compliance with national accounting rules, where these exist.  

# Background  

The purpose of this disclosure is to identify an organization’s support for political causes  

This disclosure can provide an indication of the extent to which an organization’s political contributions are in line with its stated policies, goals, or other public positions.  

Direct or indirect contributions to political causes can also present corruption risks, because they can be used to exert undue influence on the political process. Many countries have legislation that limits the amount an organization can spend on political parties and candidates for campaigning purposes. If an organization channels contributions indirectly through intermediaries, such as lobbyists or organizations linked to political causes, it can improperly circumvent such legislation.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of customer health and safety, including an organization’s systematic efforts to address health and safety across the life cycle of a product or service, and its adherence to customer health and safety regulations and voluntary codes.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

Figure 1. GRI Standards: Universal, Sector and Topic Standards  

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to customer health and safety. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 417: Marketing and Labeling 2016.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined customer health and safety to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard); • Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s impacts related to customer health and safety (Disclosure 416-1 through Disclosure 416-2).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined customer health and safety to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages customer health and safety using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# GUIDANCE  

The reporting organization can also disclose whether the health and safety impacts of products and services are assessed for improvement in each of the following life cycle stages:  

Development of product concept   
Research and development   
Certification   
Manufacturing and production   
Marketing and promotion   
Storage, distribution, and supply   
Use and service   
Disposal, reuse, or recycling  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 416-1 Assessment of the health and safety impacts of product and service categories  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Percentage of significant product and service categories for which health and safety impacts are assessed for improvement.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 416-1  

This measure helps to identify the existence and range of systematic efforts to address health and safety across the life cycle of a product or service. In reporting the information in Disclosure 416-1, the reporting organization can also describe the criteria used for the assessment.  

# Disclosure 416-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services within the reporting period, by:  

i. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a fine or penalty;   
ii. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a warning;   
iii. incidents of non-compliance with voluntary codes.  

b. If the organization has not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 416-2, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 exclude incidents of non-compliance in which the organization was determined not to be at fault;   
2.1.2 exclude incidents of non-compliance related to Incidents related to labeling are reported in Disclosure 417-2 of GRI 417: Marketing and Labelling 2016;   
2.1.3 if applicable, identify any incidents of non-compliance that relate to events in periods prior to the reporting period.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 416-2  

The incidents of non-compliance that occur within the reporting period can relate to incidents formally resolved during the reporting period, whether they occurred in periods prior to the reporting period or not.  

# Background  

Protection of health and safety is a recognized goal of many national and international regulations. Customers expect products and services to perform their intended functions satisfactorily, and not pose a risk to health and safety. Customers have a right to non-hazardous products. Where their health and safety is affected, customers also have the right to seek redress.  

This disclosure addresses the life cycle of the product or service once it is available for use, and therefore subject to regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety of products and services.  

# Glossary  

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these definitions when using the GRI Standards.  

The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.

The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on using this Standard.  

# Background on the topic  

This Standard addresses the topic of product and service information and labeling and marketing communications. This includes customer access to accurate and adequate information on the positive and negative economic, environmental, and social impacts of the products and services they consume – both from a product and service labeling and a marketing communications perspective.  

Fair and responsible marketing communications, as well as access to information about the composition of products, and their proper use and disposal, can help customers to make informed choices.  

These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: see the Bibliography.  

# System of GRI Standards  

This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.  

The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).  

# Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3  

GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.  

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to marketing and labeling.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined marketing and labeling to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s marketing and labeling-related impacts (Disclosure 417-1 through Disclosure 417-3).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.

# REQUIREMENTS  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 417-1 Requirements for product and service information and labeling  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Whether each of the following types of information is required by the organization’s procedures for product and service information and labeling:  

i. The sourcing of components of the product or service;   
ii. Content, particularly with regard to substances that might produce an environmental or social impact;   
iii. Safe use of the product or service;   
iv. Disposal of the product and environmental or social impacts;   
v. Other (explain).  

b. Percentage of significant product or service categories covered by and assessed for compliance with such procedures.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Background  

Customers and end users need accessible and adequate information about the positive and negative environmental and social impacts of products and services. This can include information on the safe use of a product or service, the disposal of the product, or the sourcing of its components. Access to this information helps customers to make informed purchasing choices.  

# Disclosure 417-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service information and labeling  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning product and service information and labeling, by: i. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a fine or penalty; ii. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a warning; iii. incidents of non-compliance with voluntary codes.   
b. If the organization has not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient.  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 417-2, the reporting organization shall:  

2.1.1 exclude incidents of non-compliance in which the organization was determined not to be at fault;   
2.1.2 if applicable, identify any incidents of non-compliance that relate to events in periods prior to the reporting period.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 417-2  

The incidents of non-compliance that occur within the reporting period can relate to incidents formally resolved during the reporting period, whether they occurred in periods prior to the reporting period or not.  

# Background  

Providing appropriate information and labeling with respect to economic, environmental, and social impacts can be linked to compliance with certain types of regulations, laws, and codes. It is, for example, linked to compliance with regulations, national laws, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. It is also potentially linked to compliance with strategies for brand and market differentiation.  

The display and provision of information and labeling for products and services are subject to many regulations and laws. Non-compliance can indicate either inadequate internal management systems and procedures or ineffective implementation. The trends revealed by this disclosure can indicate improvements or a deterioration in the effectiveness of internal controls.  

# Disclosure 417-3 Incidents of non-compliance concerning marketing communications  

# REQUIREMENTS  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning marketing communications, including advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, by: i. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a fine or penalty; ii. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a warning; iii. incidents of non-compliance with voluntary codes.   
b. If the organization has not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient.  

Compilation requirements  

2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 417-3, the reporting organization shall: 2.2.1 exclude incidents of non-compliance in which the organization was determined not to be at fault; 2.2.2 if applicable, identify any incidents of non-compliance that relate to events in periods prior to the reporting period.  

# GUIDANCE  

# Guidance for Disclosure 417-3  

The incidents of non-compliance that occur within the reporting period can relate to incidents formally resolved during the reporting period, whether they occurred in periods prior to the reporting period or not.  

# Background  

Marketing is an important method of communication between organizations and customers, and is subject to many regulations, laws, and voluntary codes, such as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)’s Consolidated Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice.  

An organization is expected to use fair and responsible practices in its business and dealings with customers. Fair and responsible marketing requires the organization to communicate transparently about the economic, environmental, and social impacts of its brands, products, and services. Fair and responsible marketing also avoids any deceptive, untruthful, or discriminatory claims, and does not take advantage of a customers’ lack of knowledge or choices.

GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.  

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics, and how it manages each topic.  

# Sector Standards  

The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to report for each material topic.  

# Topic Standards  

The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has determined using GRI 3.

# Using this Standard  

This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting experience – to report information about its impacts related to customer privacy.  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has determined customer privacy to be a material topic:  

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);   
Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s customer privacy-related impacts (Disclosure 418-1).  

See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021  

Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures  

If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.  

If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.  

If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the information has been published).  

# Requirements, guidance and defined terms  

The following apply throughout this Standard:  

Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.  

Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.  

Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.  

The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is encouraged but not required.  

The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.  

Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.  

# 1. Topic management disclosures  

An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its material topics.  

An organization that has determined customer privacy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).  

This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.  

# REQUIREMENTS  

1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages customer privacy using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.  

# 2. Topic disclosures  

# REQUIREMENTS  

# Disclosure 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data  

The reporting organization shall report the following information:  

a. Total number of substantiated complaints received concerning breaches of customer privacy, categorized by: i. complaints received from outside parties and substantiated by the organization; ii. complaints from regulatory bodies.   
b. Total number of identified leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data.   
c. If the organization has not identified any substantiated complaints, a brief statement o this fact is sufficient.  

# GUIDANCE  

Compilation requirements  

2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 418-1, the reporting organization shall indicate if a substantial number of these breaches relate to events in preceding years.  

# Background  

Protection of customer privacy is a generally recognized goal in national regulations and organizational policies. As set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, organizations are expected to ‘respect consumer privacy and take reasonable measures to ensure the security of personal data that they collect, store, process or disseminate’.  

To protect customer privacy, an organization is expected to limit its collection of personal data, to collect data by lawful means, and to be transparent about how data are gathered, used, and secured. The organization is also expected to not disclose or use personal customer information for any purposes other than those agreed upon, and to communicate any changes in data protection policies or measures to customers directly.  

This disclosure provides an evaluation of the success of management systems and procedures relating to customer privacy protection.  

# Glossary

systematic approach to enhance occupational health and safety, eliminate hazards, and minimize risks  

Note 1:  

The hierarchy of controls seeks to protect workers by ranking the ways in which hazards can be controlled. Each control in the hierarchy is considered less effective than the one before it. The priority is to eliminate the hazard, which is the most effective way to control it.  

Note 2: The International Labour Organization (ILO) Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, 2001 and ISO 45001:2018 list the following preventive and protective measures in the following order of priority:  

eliminate the hazard/risk;   
substitute the hazard/risk with less hazardous processes, operations,   
materials, or equipment;   
control the hazard/risk at source, through the use of engineering controls or organizational measures;   
minimize the hazard/risk by the design of safe work systems, which include administrative control measures;   
where residual hazards/risks cannot be controlled by collective measures, provide for appropriate personal protective equipment, including clothing, at no cost, and implement measures to ensure its use and maintenance.

‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and disorders. The terms ‘disease’, ‘illness’, and ‘disorder’ are often used interchangeably and refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses  

# Note 2:  

Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at work. Other types of incident can occur that are not connected with the work itself. For example, the following incidents are not considered to be work related:  

a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that is unconnected with work; a worker driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (where driving is not part of the work, and where the transport has not been organized by the employer); a worker with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is unconnected with work.  

# Note 3:  

Traveling for work: Injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is traveling are work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work activities ‘in the interest of the employer’. Examples of such activities include traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer).  

Working at home: Injuries and ill health that occur when working at home are work related if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work at home, and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than the general home environment or setting.  

Mental illness: A mental illness is considered to be work related if it has been notified voluntarily by the worker and is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience stating that the illness is work related.
