0,	"SALESFORCE",	"ORGANIZATION",	"Salesforce is an American cloud-based software company headquartered in San Francisco, California. Founded by Marc Benioff in 1999 and going public in 2004, Salesforce specializes in providing customer relationship management (CRM) solutions and has been ranked #1 in CRM for nine consecutive years. The organization offers a range of services including cloud computing, automation, AI, real-time data, and various platforms like Service Cloud, the Salesforce Platform, AppExchange, and Force.com. 

Salesforce is known for its significant involvement in mergers and acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Slack, with an extensive history of expanding into different sectors like cloud services, social media marketing, and data visualization. The company has achieved milestones through IPOs, leadership changes, and product launches while maintaining a commitment to corporate social responsibility initiatives, including philanthropic efforts under its '1-1-1' program and involvement in social activism measures based on legislative issues.

While Salesforce provides news, privacy policies, cloud-based customer relationship management services, and other platforms to users, it has also faced various challenges such as lawsuits involving sex trafficking allegations and disability discrimination. The company continues to be a global leader in CRM solutions, aiding companies in digitally transforming around their customers through technology advancements and hosting events like Dreamforce, while processing personal data of its users worldwide.",	135
